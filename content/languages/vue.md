### What is Vue?

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like **view**) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative, component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces of any complexity.

Here is a minimal example:

```js
import { createApp, ref } from 'vue'

createApp({
  setup() {
    return {
      count: ref(0)
    }
  }
}).mount('#app')
```

```vue-html

  <button @click="count++">
    Count is: {{ count }}
  </button>

```

**Result**

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)
</script>

  <button @click="count++">
    Count is: {{ count }}
  </button>

The above example demonstrates the two core features of Vue:

- **Declarative Rendering**: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.

- **Reactivity**: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.

You may already have questions - don't worry. We will cover every little detail in the rest of the documentation. For now, please read along so you can have a high-level understanding of what Vue offers.

> **Prerequisites:**
The rest of the documentation assumes basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics and then come back! You can check your knowledge level with these overviews for [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) if needed. Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.

### The Progressive Framework

Vue is a framework and ecosystem that covers most of the common features needed in frontend development. But the web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways:

- Enhancing static HTML without a build step
- Embedding as Web Components on any page
- Single-Page Application (SPA)
- Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal

If you find these concepts intimidating, don't worry! The tutorial and guide only require basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge, and you should be able to follow along without being an expert in any of these.

If you are an experienced developer interested in how to best integrate Vue into your stack, or you are curious about what these terms mean, we discuss them in more detail in [Ways of Using Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue).

Despite the flexibility, the core knowledge about how Vue works is shared across all these use cases. Even if you are just a beginner now, the knowledge gained along the way will stay useful as you grow to tackle more ambitious goals in the future. If you are a veteran, you can pick the optimal way to leverage Vue based on the problems you are trying to solve, while retaining the same productivity. This is why we call Vue "The Progressive Framework": it's a framework that can grow with you and adapt to your needs.

### Single-File Components

In most build-tool-enabled Vue projects, we author Vue components using an HTML-like file format called **Single-File Component** (also known as `*.vue` files, abbreviated as **SFC**). A Vue SFC, as the name suggests, encapsulates the component's logic (JavaScript), template (HTML), and styles (CSS) in a single file. Here's the previous example, written in SFC format:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>

<style scoped>
button {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```

SFC is a defining feature of Vue and is the recommended way to author Vue components **if** your use case warrants a build setup. You can learn more about the [how and why of SFC](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc) in its dedicated section - but for now, just know that Vue will handle all the build tools setup for you.

### API Styles

Vue components can be authored in two different API styles: **Options API** and **Composition API**.

#### Options API

With Options API, we define a component's logic using an object of options such as `data`, `methods`, and `mounted`. Properties defined by options are exposed on `this` inside functions, which points to the component instance:

```vue
<script>
export default {
  // Properties returned from data() become reactive state
  // and will be exposed on `this`.
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },

  // Methods are functions that mutate state and trigger updates.
  // They can be bound as event handlers in templates.
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },

  // Lifecycle hooks are called at different stages
  // of a component's lifecycle.
  // This function will be called when the component is mounted.
  mounted() {
    console.log(`The initial count is ${this.count}.`)
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

#### Composition API

With Composition API, we define a component's logic using imported API functions. In SFCs, Composition API is typically used with [`<script setup>`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup). The `setup` attribute is a hint that makes Vue perform compile-time transforms that allow us to use Composition API with less boilerplate. For example, imports and top-level variables / functions declared in `<script setup>` are directly usable in the template.

Here is the same component, with the exact same template, but using Composition API and `<script setup>` instead:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

// reactive state
const count = ref(0)

// functions that mutate state and trigger updates
function increment() {
  count.value++
}

// lifecycle hooks
onMounted(() => {
  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)
})
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

#### Which to Choose?

Both API styles are fully capable of covering common use cases. They are different interfaces powered by the exact same underlying system. In fact, the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API! The fundamental concepts and knowledge about Vue are shared across the two styles.

The Options API is centered around the concept of a "component instance" (`this` as seen in the example), which typically aligns better with a class-based mental model for users coming from OOP language backgrounds. It is also more beginner-friendly by abstracting away the reactivity details and enforcing code organization via option groups.

The Composition API is centered around declaring reactive state variables directly in a function scope and composing state from multiple functions together to handle complexity. It is more free-form and requires an understanding of how reactivity works in Vue to be used effectively. In return, its flexibility enables more powerful patterns for organizing and reusing logic.

You can learn more about the comparison between the two styles and the potential benefits of Composition API in the [Composition API FAQ](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq).

If you are new to Vue, here's our general recommendation:

- For learning purposes, go with the style that looks easier to understand to you. Again, most of the core concepts are shared between the two styles. You can always pick up the other style later.

- For production use:

  - Go with Options API if you are not using build tools, or plan to use Vue primarily in low-complexity scenarios, e.g. progressive enhancement.

  - Go with Composition API + Single-File Components if you plan to build full applications with Vue.

You don't have to commit to only one style during the learning phase. The rest of the documentation will provide code samples in both styles where applicable, and you can toggle between them at any time using the **API Preference switches** at the top of the left sidebar.

#### Creating a Vue Application

> **Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with the command line
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version `^22.18.0 || >=24.12.0`
  :::

In this section we will introduce how to scaffold a Vue [Single Page Application](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue#single-page-application-spa) on your local machine. The created project will be using a build setup based on [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and allow us to use Vue [Single-File Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc) (SFCs).

Make sure you have an up-to-date version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed and your current working directory is the one where you intend to create a project. Run the following command in your command line (without the `$` sign):

> **-Group:**

```sh
$ npm create vue@latest
```

```sh
$ pnpm create vue@latest
```

```sh
# For Yarn (v1+)
$ yarn create vue

# For Yarn Modern (v2+)
$ yarn create vue@latest

# For Yarn ^v4.11
$ yarn dlx create-vue@latest
```

```sh
$ bun create vue@latest
```

[Next Steps >](#next-steps)

#### Using Vue from CDN

You can use Vue directly from a CDN via a script tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
```

Here we are using [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/), but you can also use any CDN that serves npm packages, for example [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/vue) or [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/vue). Of course, you can also download this file and serve it yourself.

When using Vue from a CDN, there is no "build step" involved. This makes the setup a lot simpler, and is suitable for enhancing static HTML or integrating with a backend framework. However, you won't be able to use the Single-File Component (SFC) syntax.

##### Using the Global Build

The above link loads the _global build_ of Vue, where all top-level APIs are exposed as properties on the global `Vue` object. Here is a full example using the global build:

<script>
  const { createApp } = Vue

  createApp({
    data() {
      return {
        message: 'Hello Vue!'
      }
    }
  }).mount('#app')
</script>
```

[CodePen Demo >](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/QWJwJLp)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>

{{ message }}

<script>
  const { createApp, ref } = Vue

  createApp({
    setup() {
      const message = ref('Hello vue!')
      return {
        message
      }
    }
  }).mount('#app')
</script>
```

[CodePen Demo >](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/eYQpQEG)

> **Many Of The Examples For Composition Api Throughout The Guide Will Be Using The `<Script Setup>` Syntax, Which Requires Build Tools. If You Intend To Use Composition Api Without A Build Step, Consult The Usage Of The [`Setup()` Option](https://vuejs.org/Api/Composition-Api-Setup).:**

##### Using the ES Module Build

Throughout the rest of the documentation, we will be primarily using [ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) syntax. Most modern browsers now support ES modules natively, so we can use Vue from a CDN via native ES modules like this:

<script type="module">
  import { createApp } from 'https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.esm-browser.js'

  createApp({
    data() {
      return {
        message: 'Hello Vue!'
      }
    }
  }).mount('#app')
</script>
```

```html{3,4}
{{ message }}

<script type="module">
  import { createApp, ref } from 'https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.esm-browser.js'

  createApp({
    setup() {
      const message = ref('Hello Vue!')
      return {
        message
      }
    }
  }).mount('#app')
</script>
```

Notice that we are using `<script type="module">`, and the imported CDN URL is pointing to the **ES modules build** of Vue instead.

[CodePen Demo >](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/MWzazEv)

##### Enabling Import maps

In the above example, we are importing from the full CDN URL, but in the rest of the documentation you will see code like this:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
```

We can teach the browser where to locate the `vue` import by using [Import Maps](https://caniuse.com/import-maps):

<script type="module">
  import { createApp } from 'vue'

  createApp({
    data() {
      return {
        message: 'Hello Vue!'
      }
    }
  }).mount('#app')
</script>
```

[CodePen Demo >](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/wvQKQyM)

```html{1-7,12}
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "vue": "https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.esm-browser.js"
    }
  }
</script>

{{ message }}

<script type="module">
  import { createApp, ref } from 'vue'

  createApp({
    setup() {
      const message = ref('Hello Vue!')
      return {
        message
      }
    }
  }).mount('#app')
</script>
```

[CodePen Demo >](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/YzRyRYM)

You can also add entries for other dependencies to the import map - but make sure they point to the ES modules version of the library you intend to use.

> **Import Maps Browser Support:**
Import Maps is a relatively new browser feature. Make sure to use a browser within its [support range](https://caniuse.com/import-maps). In particular, it is only supported in Safari 16.4+.

> **Notes On Production Use:**
The examples so far are using the development build of Vue - if you intend to use Vue from a CDN in production, make sure to check out the [Production Deployment Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/production-deployment#without-build-tools).

While it is possible to use Vue without a build system, an alternative approach to consider is using [`vuejs/petite-vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) that could better suit the context where [`jquery/jquery`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) (in the past) or [`alpinejs/alpine`](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) (in the present) might be used instead.

##### Splitting Up the Modules

As we dive deeper into the guide, we may need to split our code into separate JavaScript files so that they are easier to manage. For example:

```html

<script type="module">
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import MyComponent from './my-component.js'

  createApp(MyComponent).mount('#app')
</script>
```

`
}
```

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'
export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)
    return { count }
  },
  template: `Count is: {{ count }}`
}
```

If you directly open the above `index.html` in your browser, you will find that it throws an error because ES modules cannot work over the `file://` protocol, which is the protocol the browser uses when you open a local file.

Due to security reasons, ES modules can only work over the `http://` protocol, which is what the browsers use when opening pages on the web. In order for ES modules to work on our local machine, we need to serve the `index.html` over the `http://` protocol, with a local HTTP server.

To start a local HTTP server, first make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then run `npx serve` from the command line in the same directory where your HTML file is. You can also use any other HTTP server that can serve static files with the correct MIME types.

You may have noticed that the imported component's template is inlined as a JavaScript string. If you are using VS Code, you can install the [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) extension and prefix the strings with a `/*html*/` comment to get syntax highlighting for them.

#### Frameworks

There are Vue frameworks which support [SSR](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr) and other features out-of-the-box:
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [Vike](https://vike.dev/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)

> **The General Recommendation Is To Use A Framework Only If You Need Ssr.:**

If you don't need SSR, you can simply use [Vite](https://vite.dev/) (this is what the section above [Creating a Vue Application](#creating-a-vue-application) scaffolds).

> **Vue Frameworks Typically Use Vite Under The Hood, So Directly Using Vite Instead Of A Vue Framework Is A Simpler Setup If You Don'T Need Ssr. That Said, Frameworks Also Support Extra Features, Such As Ui Themes, Which Can Also Be A Reason To Favor A Vue Framework Instead Of Just Using Vite.:**

#### Next Steps

If you skipped the [Introduction](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction), we strongly recommend reading it before moving on to the rest of the documentation.

> **Source:** [Creating a Vue Application](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

### The Application Instance

Every Vue application starts by creating a new **application instance** with the [`createApp`](https://vuejs.org/api/application#createapp) function:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp({
  /* root component options */
})
```

### The Root Component

The object we are passing into `createApp` is in fact a component. Every app requires a "root component" that can contain other components as its children.

If you are using Single-File Components, we typically import the root component from another file:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
// import the root component App from a single-file component.
import App from './App.vue'

const app = createApp(App)
```

While many examples in this guide only need a single component, most real applications are organized into a tree of nested, reusable components. For example, a Todo application's component tree might look like this:

```
App (root component)
├─ TodoList
│  └─ TodoItem
│     ├─ TodoDeleteButton
│     └─ TodoEditButton
└─ TodoFooter
   ├─ TodoClearButton
   └─ TodoStatistics
```

In later sections of the guide, we will discuss how to define and compose multiple components together. Before that, we will focus on what happens inside a single component.

### Mounting the App

An application instance won't render anything until its `.mount()` method is called. It expects a "container" argument, which can either be an actual DOM element or a selector string:

```html

```

```js
app.mount('#app')
```

The content of the app's root component will be rendered inside the container element. The container element itself is not considered part of the app.

The `.mount()` method should always be called after all app configurations and asset registrations are done. Also note that its return value, unlike the asset registration methods, is the root component instance instead of the application instance.

#### In-DOM Root Component Template

The template for the root component is usually part of the component itself, but it is also possible to provide the template separately by writing it directly inside the mount container:

```html

  <button @click="count++">{{ count }}</button>

```

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  }
})

app.mount('#app')
```

Vue will automatically use the container's `innerHTML` as the template if the root component does not already have a `template` option.

In-DOM templates are often used in applications that are [using Vue without a build step](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#using-vue-from-cdn). They can also be used in conjunction with server-side frameworks, where the root template might be generated dynamically by the server.

### App Configurations

The application instance exposes a `.config` object that allows us to configure a few app-level options, for example, defining an app-level error handler that captures errors from all descendant components:

```js
app.config.errorHandler = (err) => {
  /* handle error */
}
```

The application instance also provides a few methods for registering app-scoped assets. For example, registering a component:

```js
app.component('TodoDeleteButton', TodoDeleteButton)
```

This makes the `TodoDeleteButton` available for use anywhere in our app. We will discuss registration for components and other types of assets in later sections of the guide. You can also browse the full list of application instance APIs in its [API reference](https://vuejs.org/api/application).

Make sure to apply all app configurations before mounting the app!

### Multiple Application Instances

You are not limited to a single application instance on the same page. The `createApp` API allows multiple Vue applications to co-exist on the same page, each with its own scope for configuration and global assets:

```js
const app1 = createApp({
  /* ... */
})
app1.mount('#container-1')

const app2 = createApp({
  /* ... */
})
app2.mount('#container-2')
```

If you are using Vue to enhance server-rendered HTML and only need Vue to control specific parts of a large page, avoid mounting a single Vue application instance on the entire page. Instead, create multiple small application instances and mount them on the elements they are responsible for.

## Template Syntax

> **Source:** [Template Syntax](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

  Watch an interactive video lesson on Scrimba

Vue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying component instance's data. All Vue templates are syntactically valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers.

Under the hood, Vue compiles the templates into highly-optimized JavaScript code. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue can intelligently figure out the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.

If you are familiar with Virtual DOM concepts and prefer the raw power of JavaScript, you can also [directly write render functions](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/render-function) instead of templates, with optional JSX support. However, do note that they do not enjoy the same level of compile-time optimizations as templates.

### Text Interpolation

The most basic form of data binding is text interpolation using the "Mustache" syntax (double curly braces):

```vue-html
<span>Message: {{ msg }}</span>
```

The mustache tag will be replaced with the value of the `msg` property [from the corresponding component instance](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals#declaring-reactive-state). It will also be updated whenever the `msg` property changes.

### Raw HTML

The double mustaches interpret the data as plain text, not HTML. In order to output real HTML, you will need to use the [`v-html` directive](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives#v-html):

```vue-html
<p>Using text interpolation: {{ rawHtml }}</p>
<p>Using v-html directive: <span v-html="rawHtml"></span></p>
```

<script setup>
  const rawHtml = '<span style="color: red">This should be red.</span>'
</script>

  <p>Using text interpolation: {{ rawHtml }}</p>
  <p>Using v-html directive: <span v-html="rawHtml"></span></p>

Here we're encountering something new. The `v-html` attribute you're seeing is called a **directive**. Directives are prefixed with `v-` to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, we're basically saying "keep this element's inner HTML up-to-date with the `rawHtml` property on the current active instance."

The contents of the `span` will be replaced with the value of the `rawHtml` property, interpreted as plain HTML - data bindings are ignored. Note that you cannot use `v-html` to compose template partials, because Vue is not a string-based templating engine. Instead, components are preferred as the fundamental unit for UI reuse and composition.

> **Security Warning:**
Dynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous because it can easily lead to [XSS vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Only use `v-html` on trusted content and **never** on user-provided content.

### Attribute Bindings

Mustaches cannot be used inside HTML attributes. Instead, use a [`v-bind` directive](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives#v-bind):

```vue-html

```

The `v-bind` directive instructs Vue to keep the element's `id` attribute in sync with the component's `dynamicId` property. If the bound value is `null` or `undefined`, then the attribute will be removed from the rendered element.

#### Shorthand

Because `v-bind` is so commonly used, it has a dedicated shorthand syntax:

```vue-html

```

Attributes that start with `:` may look a bit different from normal HTML, but it is in fact a valid character for attribute names and all Vue-supported browsers can parse it correctly. In addition, they do not appear in the final rendered markup. The shorthand syntax is optional, but you will likely appreciate it when you learn more about its usage later.

> For the rest of the guide, we will be using the shorthand syntax in code examples, as that's the most common usage for Vue developers.

#### Same-name Shorthand

- Only supported in 3.4+

If the attribute has the same name as the variable name of the JavaScript value being bound, the syntax can be further shortened to omit the attribute value:

```vue-html
<!-- same as :id="id" -->

<!-- this also works -->

```

This is similar to the property shorthand syntax when declaring objects in JavaScript. Note this is a feature that is only available in Vue 3.4 and above.

#### Boolean Attributes

[Boolean attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attributes) are attributes that can indicate true / false values by their presence on an element. For example, [`disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) is one of the most commonly used boolean attributes.

`v-bind` works a bit differently in this case:

```vue-html
<button :disabled="isButtonDisabled">Button</button>
```

The `disabled` attribute will be included if `isButtonDisabled` has a [truthy value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy). It will also be included if the value is an empty string, maintaining consistency with `<button disabled="">`. For other [falsy values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) the attribute will be omitted.

#### Dynamically Binding Multiple Attributes

If you have a JavaScript object representing multiple attributes that looks like this:

```js
const objectOfAttrs = {
  id: 'container',
  class: 'wrapper',
  style: 'background-color:green'
}
```

You can bind them to a single element by using `v-bind` without an argument:

```vue-html

```

### Using JavaScript Expressions

So far we've only been binding to simple property keys in our templates. But Vue actually supports the full power of JavaScript expressions inside all data bindings:

```vue-html
{{ number + 1 }}

{{ ok ? 'YES' : 'NO' }}

{{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}

```

These expressions will be evaluated as JavaScript in the data scope of the current component instance.

In Vue templates, JavaScript expressions can be used in the following positions:

- Inside text interpolations (mustaches)
- In the attribute value of any Vue directives (special attributes that start with `v-`)

#### Expressions Only

Each binding can only contain **one single expression**. An expression is a piece of code that can be evaluated to a value. A simple check is whether it can be used after `return`.

Therefore, the following will **NOT** work:

```vue-html
<!-- this is a statement, not an expression: -->
{{ var a = 1 }}

<!-- flow control won't work either, use ternary expressions -->
{{ if (ok) { return message } }}
```

#### Calling Functions

It is possible to call a component-exposed method inside a binding expression:

```vue-html
<time :title="toTitleDate(date)" :datetime="date">
  {{ formatDate(date) }}
</time>
```

> **Functions Called Inside Binding Expressions Will Be Called Every Time The Component Updates, So They Should **Not** Have Any Side Effects, Such As Changing Data Or Triggering Asynchronous Operations.:**

#### Restricted Globals Access

Template expressions are sandboxed and only have access to a [restricted list of globals](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/shared/src/globalsAllowList.ts#L3). The list exposes commonly used built-in globals such as `Math` and `Date`.

Globals not explicitly included in the list, for example user-attached properties on `window`, will not be accessible in template expressions. You can, however, explicitly define additional globals for all Vue expressions by adding them to [`app.config.globalProperties`](https://vuejs.org/api/application#app-config-globalproperties).

### Directives

Directives are special attributes with the `v-` prefix. Vue provides a number of [built-in directives](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives), including `v-html` and `v-bind` which we have introduced above.

Directive attribute values are expected to be single JavaScript expressions (with the exception of `v-for`, `v-on` and `v-slot`, which will be discussed in their respective sections later). A directive's job is to reactively apply updates to the DOM when the value of its expression changes. Take [`v-if`](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives#v-if) as an example:

```vue-html
<p v-if="seen">Now you see me</p>
```

Here, the `v-if` directive would remove or insert the `<p>` element based on the truthiness of the value of the expression `seen`.

#### Arguments

Some directives can take an "argument", denoted by a colon after the directive name. For example, the `v-bind` directive is used to reactively update an HTML attribute:

```vue-html
<a v-bind:href="url"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a :href="url"> ... </a>
```

Here, `href` is the argument, which tells the `v-bind` directive to bind the element's `href` attribute to the value of the expression `url`. In the shorthand, everything before the argument (i.e., `v-bind:`) is condensed into a single character, `:`.

Another example is the `v-on` directive, which listens to DOM events:

```vue-html
<a v-on:click="doSomething"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a @click="doSomething"> ... </a>
```

Here, the argument is the event name to listen to: `click`. `v-on` has a corresponding shorthand, namely the `@` character. We will talk about event handling in more detail too.

#### Dynamic Arguments

It is also possible to use a JavaScript expression in a directive argument by wrapping it with square brackets:

```vue-html
<!--
Note that there are some constraints to the argument expression,
as explained in the "Dynamic Argument Value Constraints" and "Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints" sections below.
-->
<a v-bind:[attributeName]="url"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a :[attributeName]="url"> ... </a>
```

Here, `attributeName` will be dynamically evaluated as a JavaScript expression, and its evaluated value will be used as the final value for the argument. For example, if your component instance has a data property, `attributeName`, whose value is `"href"`, then this binding will be equivalent to `v-bind:href`.

Similarly, you can use dynamic arguments to bind a handler to a dynamic event name:

```vue-html
<a v-on:[eventName]="doSomething"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a @[eventName]="doSomething"> ... </a>
```

In this example, when `eventName`'s value is `"focus"`, `v-on:[eventName]` will be equivalent to `v-on:focus`.

##### Dynamic Argument Value Constraints

Dynamic arguments are expected to evaluate to a string, with the exception of `null`. The special value `null` can be used to explicitly remove the binding. Any other non-string value will trigger a warning.

##### Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints

Dynamic argument expressions have some syntax constraints because certain characters, such as spaces and quotes, are invalid inside HTML attribute names. For example, the following is invalid:

```vue-html
<!-- This will trigger a compiler warning. -->
<a :['foo' + bar]="value"> ... </a>
```

If you need to pass a complex dynamic argument, it's probably better to use a [computed property](https://vuejs.org/guide/./computed), which we will cover shortly.

When using in-DOM templates (templates directly written in an HTML file), you should also avoid naming keys with uppercase characters, as browsers will coerce attribute names into lowercase:

```vue-html
<a :[someAttr]="value"> ... </a>
```

The above will be converted to `:[someattr]` in in-DOM templates. If your component has a `someAttr` property instead of `someattr`, your code won't work. Templates inside Single-File Components are **not** subject to this constraint.

#### Modifiers

Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. For example, the `.prevent` modifier tells the `v-on` directive to call `event.preventDefault()` on the triggered event:

```vue-html
<form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">...</form>
```

You'll see other examples of modifiers later, [for `v-on`](https://vuejs.org/guide/./event-handling#event-modifiers) and [for `v-model`](https://vuejs.org/guide/./forms#modifiers), when we explore those features.

And finally, here's the full directive syntax visualized:

### Declaring Reactive State \*\*

#### `ref()` \*\*

In Composition API, the recommended way to declare reactive state is using the [`ref()`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core#ref) function:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
```

`ref()` takes the argument and returns it wrapped within a ref object with a `.value` property:

```js
const count = ref(0)

console.log(count) // { value: 0 }
console.log(count.value) // 0

count.value++
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

> See also: [Typing Refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-ref) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

To access refs in a component's template, declare and return them from a component's `setup()` function:

```js{5,9-11}
import { ref } from 'vue'

export default {
  // `setup` is a special hook dedicated for the Composition API.
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)

    // expose the ref to the template
    return {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

```vue-html
{{ count }}
```

Notice that we did **not** need to append `.value` when using the ref in the template. For convenience, refs are automatically unwrapped when used inside templates (with a few [caveats](#caveat-when-unwrapping-in-templates)).

You can also mutate a ref directly in event handlers:

```vue-html{1}
<button @click="count++">
  {{ count }}
</button>
```

For more complex logic, we can declare functions that mutate refs in the same scope and expose them as methods alongside the state:

```js{7-10,15}
import { ref } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)

    function increment() {
      // .value is needed in JavaScript
      count.value++
    }

    // don't forget to expose the function as well.
    return {
      count,
      increment
    }
  }
}
```

Exposed methods can then be used as event handlers:

```vue-html{1}
<button @click="increment">
  {{ count }}
</button>
```

Here's the example live on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/WNYbaqo), without using any build tools.

#### `<script setup>` \*\*

Manually exposing state and methods via `setup()` can be verbose. Luckily, it can be avoided when using [Single-File Components (SFCs)](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc). We can simplify the usage with `<script setup>`:

```vue{1}
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

function increment() {
  count.value++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">
    {{ count }}
  </button>
</template>
```

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jUEKgzAQRa8yZKMiaNcllvYe2dgwQqiZhDhxE3L3jrW4/DPvv1/UK8Zhz6juSm82uciwIef4MOR8DImhQMIFKiwpeGgEbQwZsoE2BhsyMUwH0d66475ksuwCgSOb0CNx20ExBCc77POase8NVUN6PBdlSwKjj+vMKAlAvzOzWJ52dfYzGXXpjPoBAKX856uopDGeFfnq8XKp+gWq4FAi)

Top-level imports, variables and functions declared in `<script setup>` are automatically usable in the template of the same component. Think of the template as a JavaScript function declared in the same scope - it naturally has access to everything declared alongside it.

> **For The Rest Of The Guide, We Will Be Primarily Using Sfc + `<Script Setup>` Syntax For The Composition Api Code Examples, As That Is The Most Common Usage For Vue Developers.:**

If you are not using SFC, you can still use Composition API with the [`setup()`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-setup) option.

#### Why Refs? \*\*

You might be wondering why we need refs with the `.value` instead of plain variables. To explain that, we will need to briefly discuss how Vue's reactivity system works.

When you use a ref in a template, and change the ref's value later, Vue automatically detects the change and updates the DOM accordingly. This is made possible with a dependency-tracking based reactivity system. When a component is rendered for the first time, Vue **tracks** every ref that was used during the render. Later on, when a ref is mutated, it will **trigger** a re-render for components that are tracking it.

In standard JavaScript, there is no way to detect the access or mutation of plain variables. However, we can intercept the get and set operations of an object's properties using getter and setter methods.

The `.value` property gives Vue the opportunity to detect when a ref has been accessed or mutated. Under the hood, Vue performs the tracking in its getter, and performs triggering in its setter. Conceptually, you can think of a ref as an object that looks like this:

```js
// pseudo code, not actual implementation
const myRef = {
  _value: 0,
  get value() {
    track()
    return this._value
  },
  set value(newValue) {
    this._value = newValue
    trigger()
  }
}
```

Another nice trait of refs is that unlike plain variables, you can pass refs into functions while retaining access to the latest value and the reactivity connection. This is particularly useful when refactoring complex logic into reusable code.

The reactivity system is discussed in more details in the [Reactivity in Depth](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth) section.

#### Deep Reactivity

Refs can hold any value type, including deeply nested objects, arrays, or JavaScript built-in data structures like `Map`.

A ref will make its value deeply reactive. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

const obj = ref({
  nested: { count: 0 },
  arr: ['foo', 'bar']
})

function mutateDeeply() {
  // these will work as expected.
  obj.value.nested.count++
  obj.value.arr.push('baz')
}
```

Non-primitive values are turned into reactive proxies via [`reactive()`](#reactive), which is discussed below.

It is also possible to opt-out of deep reactivity with [shallow refs](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref). For shallow refs, only `.value` access is tracked for reactivity. Shallow refs can be used for optimizing performance by avoiding the observation cost of large objects, or in cases where the inner state is managed by an external library.

Further reading:

- [Reduce Reactivity Overhead for Large Immutable Structures](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/performance#reduce-reactivity-overhead-for-large-immutable-structures)
- [Integration with External State Systems](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#integration-with-external-state-systems)

#### DOM Update Timing

When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the [nextTick()](https://vuejs.org/api/general#nexttick) global API:

```js
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

async function increment() {
  count.value++
  await nextTick()
  // Now the DOM is updated
}
```

### `reactive()` \*\*

There is another way to declare reactive state, with the `reactive()` API. Unlike a ref which wraps the inner value in a special object, `reactive()` makes an object itself reactive:

```js
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
```

> See also: [Typing Reactive](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-reactive) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

Usage in template:

```vue-html
<button @click="state.count++">
  {{ state.count }}
</button>
```

Reactive objects are [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and behave just like normal objects. The difference is that Vue is able to intercept the access and mutation of all properties of a reactive object for reactivity tracking and triggering.

`reactive()` converts the object deeply: nested objects are also wrapped with `reactive()` when accessed. It is also called by `ref()` internally when the ref value is an object. Similar to shallow refs, there is also the [`shallowReactive()`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) API for opting-out of deep reactivity.

#### Reactive Proxy vs. Original \*\*

It is important to note that the returned value from `reactive()` is a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) of the original object, which is not equal to the original object:

```js
const raw = {}
const proxy = reactive(raw)

// proxy is NOT equal to the original.
console.log(proxy === raw) // false
```

Only the proxy is reactive - mutating the original object will not trigger updates. Therefore, the best practice when working with Vue's reactivity system is to **exclusively use the proxied versions of your state**.

To ensure consistent access to the proxy, calling `reactive()` on the same object always returns the same proxy, and calling `reactive()` on an existing proxy also returns that same proxy:

```js
// calling reactive() on the same object returns the same proxy
console.log(reactive(raw) === proxy) // true

// calling reactive() on a proxy returns itself
console.log(reactive(proxy) === proxy) // true
```

This rule applies to nested objects as well. Due to deep reactivity, nested objects inside a reactive object are also proxies:

```js
const proxy = reactive({})

const raw = {}
proxy.nested = raw

console.log(proxy.nested === raw) // false
```

#### Limitations of `reactive()` \*\*

The `reactive()` API has a few limitations:

1. **Limited value types:** it only works for object types (objects, arrays, and [collection types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects#keyed_collections) such as `Map` and `Set`). It cannot hold [primitive types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) such as `string`, `number` or `boolean`.

2. **Cannot replace entire object:** since Vue's reactivity tracking works over property access, we must always keep the same reference to the reactive object. This means we can't easily "replace" a reactive object because the reactivity connection to the first reference is lost:

   ```js
   let state = reactive({ count: 0 })

   // the above reference ({ count: 0 }) is no longer being tracked
   // (reactivity connection is lost!)
   state = reactive({ count: 1 })
   ```

3. **Not destructure-friendly:** when we destructure a reactive object's primitive type property into local variables, or when we pass that property into a function, we will lose the reactivity connection:

   ```js
   const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

   // count is disconnected from state.count when destructured.
   let { count } = state
   // does not affect original state
   count++

   // the function receives a plain number and
   // won't be able to track changes to state.count
   // we have to pass the entire object in to retain reactivity
   callSomeFunction(state.count)
   ```

Due to these limitations, we recommend using `ref()` as the primary API for declaring reactive state.

### Additional Ref Unwrapping Details \*\*

#### As Reactive Object Property \*\*

A ref is automatically unwrapped when accessed or mutated as a property of a reactive object. In other words, it behaves like a normal property:

```js
const count = ref(0)
const state = reactive({
  count
})

console.log(state.count) // 0

state.count = 1
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

If a new ref is assigned to a property linked to an existing ref, it will replace the old ref:

```js
const otherCount = ref(2)

state.count = otherCount
console.log(state.count) // 2
// original ref is now disconnected from state.count
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

Ref unwrapping only happens when nested inside a deep reactive object. It does not apply when it is accessed as a property of a [shallow reactive object](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive).

#### Caveat in Arrays and Collections \*\*

Unlike reactive objects, there is **no** unwrapping performed when the ref is accessed as an element of a reactive array or a native collection type like `Map`:

```js
const books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])
// need .value here
console.log(books[0].value)

const map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))
// need .value here
console.log(map.get('count').value)
```

#### Caveat when Unwrapping in Templates \*\*

Ref unwrapping in templates only applies if the ref is a top-level property in the template render context.

In the example below, `count` and `object` are top-level properties, but `object.id` is not:

```js
const count = ref(0)
const object = { id: ref(1) }
```

Therefore, this expression works as expected:

```vue-html
{{ count + 1 }}
```

...while this one does **NOT**:

```vue-html
{{ object.id + 1 }}
```

The rendered result will be `[object Object]1` because `object.id` is not unwrapped when evaluating the expression and remains a ref object. To fix this, we can destructure `id` into a top-level property:

```js
const { id } = object
```

```vue-html
{{ id + 1 }}
```

Now the render result will be `2`.

Another thing to note is that a ref does get unwrapped if it is the final evaluated value of a text interpolation (i.e. a <code v-pre>{{ }}</code> tag), so the following will render `1`:

```vue-html
{{ object.id }}
```

This is just a convenience feature of text interpolation and is equivalent to <code v-pre>{{ object.id.value }}</code>.

## Computed Properties

> **Source:** [Computed Properties](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

### Basic Example

In-template expressions are very convenient, but they are meant for simple operations. Putting too much logic in your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain. For example, if we have an object with a nested array:

```js
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})
```

And we want to display different messages depending on if `author` already has some books or not:

```vue-html
<p>Has published books:</p>
<span>{{ author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}</span>
```

At this point, the template is getting a bit cluttered. We have to look at it for a second before realizing that it performs a calculation depending on `author.books`. More importantly, we probably don't want to repeat ourselves if we need to include this calculation in the template more than once.

That's why for complex logic that includes reactive data, it is recommended to use a **computed property**. Here's the same example, refactored:

```vue
<script setup>
import { reactive, computed } from 'vue'

const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})

// a computed ref
const publishedBooksMessage = computed(() => {
  return author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
})
</script>

<template>
  <p>Has published books:</p>
  <span>{{ publishedBooksMessage }}</span>
</template>
```

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp1kE9Lw0AQxb/KI5dtoTainkoaaREUoZ5EEONhm0ybYLO77J9CCfnuzta0vdjbzr6Zeb95XbIwZroPlMySzJW2MR6OfDB5oZrWaOvRwZIsfbOnCUrdmuCpQo+N1S0ET4pCFarUynnI4GttMT9PjLpCAUq2NIN41bXCkyYxiZ9rrX/cDF/xDYiPQLjDDRbVXqqSHZ5DUw2tg3zP8lK6pvxHe2DtvSasDs6TPTAT8F2ofhzh0hTygm5pc+I1Yb1rXE3VMsKsyDm5JcY/9Y5GY8xzHI+wnIpVw4nTI/10R2rra+S4xSPEJzkBvvNNs310ztK/RDlLLjy1Zic9cQVkJn+R7gIwxJGlMXiWnZEq77orhH3Pq2NH9DjvTfpfSBSbmA==)

Here we have declared a computed property `publishedBooksMessage`. The `computed()` function expects to be passed a [getter function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get#description), and the returned value is a **computed ref**. Similar to normal refs, you can access the computed result as `publishedBooksMessage.value`. Computed refs are also auto-unwrapped in templates so you can reference them without `.value` in template expressions.

A computed property automatically tracks its reactive dependencies. Vue is aware that the computation of `publishedBooksMessage` depends on `author.books`, so it will update any bindings that depend on `publishedBooksMessage` when `author.books` changes.

See also: [Typing Computed](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-computed) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

### Computed Caching vs. Methods

You may have noticed we can achieve the same result by invoking a method in the expression:

```vue-html
<p>{{ calculateBooksMessage() }}</p>
```

```js
// in component
function calculateBooksMessage() {
  return author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
}
```

Instead of a computed property, we can define the same function as a method. For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly the same. However, the difference is that **computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies.** A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. This means as long as `author.books` has not changed, multiple access to `publishedBooksMessage` will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the getter function again.

This also means the following computed property will never update, because `Date.now()` is not a reactive dependency:

```js
const now = computed(() => Date.now())
```

In comparison, a method invocation will **always** run the function whenever a re-render happens.

Why do we need caching? Imagine we have an expensive computed property `list`, which requires looping through a huge array and doing a lot of computations. Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on `list`. Without caching, we would be executing `list`’s getter many more times than necessary! In cases where you do not want caching, use a method call instead.

### Writable Computed

Computed properties are by default getter-only. If you attempt to assign a new value to a computed property, you will receive a runtime warning. In the rare cases where you need a "writable" computed property, you can create one by providing both a getter and a setter:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const firstName = ref('John')
const lastName = ref('Doe')

const fullName = computed({
  // getter
  get() {
    return firstName.value + ' ' + lastName.value
  },
  // setter
  set(newValue) {
    // Note: we are using destructuring assignment syntax here.
    [firstName.value, lastName.value] = newValue.split(' ')
  }
})
</script>
```

Now when you run `fullName.value = 'John Doe'`, the setter will be invoked and `firstName` and `lastName` will be updated accordingly.

### Getting the Previous Value

- Only supported in 3.4+

<p class="options-api">
In case you need it, you can get the previous value returned by the computed property accessing
the second argument of the getter:
</p>

<p class="composition-api">
In case you need it, you can get the previous value returned by the computed property accessing
the first argument of the getter:
</p>

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const count = ref(2)

// This computed will return the value of count when it's less or equal to 3.
// When count is >=4, the last value that fulfilled our condition will be returned
// instead until count is less or equal to 3
const alwaysSmall = computed((previous) => {
  if (count.value <= 3) {
    return count.value
  }

  return previous
})
</script>
```

In case you're using a writable computed:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const count = ref(2)

const alwaysSmall = computed({
  get(previous) {
    if (count.value <= 3) {
      return count.value
    }

    return previous
  },
  set(newValue) {
    count.value = newValue * 2
  }
})
</script>
```

### Best Practices

#### Getters should be side-effect free

It is important to remember that computed getter functions should only perform pure computation and be free of side effects. For example, **don't mutate other state, make async requests, or mutate the DOM inside a computed getter!** Think of a computed property as declaratively describing how to derive a value based on other values - its only responsibility should be computing and returning that value. Later in the guide we will discuss how we can perform side effects in reaction to state changes with [watchers](https://vuejs.org/guide/./watchers).

#### Avoid mutating computed value

The returned value from a computed property is derived state. Think of it as a temporary snapshot - every time the source state changes, a new snapshot is created. It does not make sense to mutate a snapshot, so a computed return value should be treated as read-only and never be mutated - instead, update the source state it depends on to trigger new computations.

## Class and Style Bindings

> **Source:** [Class and Style Bindings](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/class-and-style.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

A common need for data binding is manipulating an element's class list and inline styles. Since `class` and `style` are both attributes, we can use `v-bind` to assign them a string value dynamically, much like with other attributes. However, trying to generate those values using string concatenation can be annoying and error-prone. For this reason, Vue provides special enhancements when `v-bind` is used with `class` and `style`. In addition to strings, the expressions can also evaluate to objects or arrays.

### Binding HTML Classes

#### Binding to Objects

We can pass an object to `:class` (short for `v-bind:class`) to dynamically toggle classes:

```vue-html

```

The above syntax means the presence of the `active` class will be determined by the [truthiness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) of the data property `isActive`.

You can have multiple classes toggled by having more fields in the object. In addition, the `:class` directive can also co-exist with the plain `class` attribute. So given the following state:

```js
const isActive = ref(true)
const hasError = ref(false)
```

And the following template:

```vue-html

```

It will render:

```vue-html

```

When `isActive` or `hasError` changes, the class list will be updated accordingly. For example, if `hasError` becomes `true`, the class list will become `"static active text-danger"`.

The bound object doesn't have to be inline:

```js
const classObject = reactive({
  active: true,
  'text-danger': false
})
```

```vue-html

```

This will render:

```vue-html

```

We can also bind to a [computed property](https://vuejs.org/guide/./computed) that returns an object. This is a common and powerful pattern:

```js
const isActive = ref(true)
const error = ref(null)

const classObject = computed(() => ({
  active: isActive.value && !error.value,
  'text-danger': error.value && error.value.type === 'fatal'
}))
```

```vue-html

```

#### Binding to Arrays

We can bind `:class` to an array to apply a list of classes:

```js
const activeClass = ref('active')
const errorClass = ref('text-danger')
```

```vue-html

```

Which will render:

```vue-html

```

If you would like to also toggle a class in the list conditionally, you can do it with a ternary expression:

```vue-html

```

This will always apply `errorClass`, but `activeClass` will only be applied when `isActive` is truthy.

However, this can be a bit verbose if you have multiple conditional classes. That's why it's also possible to use the object syntax inside the array syntax:

```vue-html

```

#### With Components

> This section assumes knowledge of [Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics). Feel free to skip it and come back later.

When you use the `class` attribute on a component with a single root element, those classes will be added to the component's root element and merged with any existing class already on it.

For example, if we have a component named `MyComponent` with the following template:

```vue-html
<!-- child component template -->
<p class="foo bar">Hi!</p>
```

Then add some classes when using it:

```vue-html
<!-- when using the component -->
<MyComponent class="baz boo" />
```

The rendered HTML will be:

```vue-html
<p class="foo bar baz boo">Hi!</p>
```

The same is true for class bindings:

```vue-html
<MyComponent :class="{ active: isActive }" />
```

When `isActive` is truthy, the rendered HTML will be:

```vue-html
<p class="foo bar active">Hi!</p>
```

If your component has multiple root elements, you would need to define which element will receive this class. You can do this using the `$attrs` component property:

```vue-html
<!-- MyComponent template using $attrs -->
<p :class="$attrs.class">Hi!</p>
<span>This is a child component</span>
```

```vue-html
<MyComponent class="baz" />
```

Will render:

```html
<p class="baz">Hi!</p>
<span>This is a child component</span>
```

You can learn more about component attribute inheritance in [Fallthrough Attributes](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs) section.

### Binding Inline Styles

#### Binding to Objects

`:style` supports binding to JavaScript object values - it corresponds to an [HTML element's `style` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style):

```js
const activeColor = ref('red')
const fontSize = ref(30)
```

```vue-html

```

Although camelCase keys are recommended, `:style` also supports kebab-cased CSS property keys (corresponds to how they are used in actual CSS) - for example:

```vue-html

```

It is often a good idea to bind to a style object directly so that the template is cleaner:

```js
const styleObject = reactive({
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: '30px'
})
```

```vue-html

```

Again, object style binding is often used in conjunction with computed properties that return objects.

`:style` directives can also coexist with regular style attributes, just like `:class`.

Template:

```vue-html
<h1 style="color: red" :style="'font-size: 1em'">hello</h1>
```

It will render:

```vue-html
<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 1em;">hello</h1>
```

#### Binding to Arrays

We can bind `:style` to an array of multiple style objects. These objects will be merged and applied to the same element:

```vue-html

```

#### Auto-prefixing

When you use a CSS property that requires a [vendor prefix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix) in `:style`, Vue will automatically add the appropriate prefix. Vue does this by checking at runtime to see which style properties are supported in the current browser. If the browser doesn't support a particular property then various prefixed variants will be tested to try to find one that is supported.

#### Multiple Values

You can provide an array of multiple (prefixed) values to a style property, for example:

```vue-html

```

This will only render the last value in the array which the browser supports. In this example, it will render `display: flex` for browsers that support the unprefixed version of flexbox.

## Conditional Rendering

> **Source:** [Conditional Rendering](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const awesome = ref(true)
</script>

### `v-if`

The directive `v-if` is used to conditionally render a block. The block will only be rendered if the directive's expression returns a truthy value.

```vue-html
<h1 v-if="awesome">Vue is awesome!</h1>
```

### `v-else`

You can use the `v-else` directive to indicate an "else block" for `v-if`:

```vue-html
<button @click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle</button>

<h1 v-if="awesome">Vue is awesome!</h1>
<h1 v-else>Oh no 😢</h1>
```

  <button @click="awesome = !awesome">Toggle</button>
  <h1 v-if="awesome">Vue is awesome!</h1>
  <h1 v-else>Oh no 😢</h1>

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpFjkEOgjAQRa8ydIMulLA1hegJ3LnqBskAjdA27RQXhHu4M/GEHsEiKLv5mfdf/sBOxux7j+zAuCutNAQOyZtcKNkZbQkGsFjBCJXVHcQBjYUSqtTKERR3dLpDyCZmQ9bjViiezKKgCIGwM21BGBIAv3oireBYtrK8ZYKtgmg5BctJ13WLPJnhr0YQb1Lod7JaS4G8eATpfjMinjTphC8wtg7zcwNKw/v5eC1fnvwnsfEDwaha7w==)

A `v-else` element must immediately follow a `v-if` or a `v-else-if` element - otherwise it will not be recognized.

### `v-else-if`

The `v-else-if`, as the name suggests, serves as an "else if block" for `v-if`. It can also be chained multiple times:

```vue-html

  A

  B

  C

  Not A/B/C

```

Similar to `v-else`, a `v-else-if` element must immediately follow a `v-if` or a `v-else-if` element.

### `v-if` on `<template>`

Because `v-if` is a directive, it has to be attached to a single element. But what if we want to toggle more than one element? In this case we can use `v-if` on a `<template>` element, which serves as an invisible wrapper. The final rendered result will not include the `<template>` element.

```vue-html
<template v-if="ok">
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Paragraph 1</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2</p>
</template>
```

`v-else` and `v-else-if` can also be used on `<template>`.

### `v-show`

Another option for conditionally displaying an element is the `v-show` directive. The usage is largely the same:

```vue-html
<h1 v-show="ok">Hello!</h1>
```

The difference is that an element with `v-show` will always be rendered and remain in the DOM; `v-show` only toggles the `display` CSS property of the element.

`v-show` doesn't support the `<template>` element, nor does it work with `v-else`.

### `v-if` vs. `v-show`

`v-if` is "real" conditional rendering because it ensures that event listeners and child components inside the conditional block are properly destroyed and re-created during toggles.

`v-if` is also **lazy**: if the condition is false on initial render, it will not do anything - the conditional block won't be rendered until the condition becomes true for the first time.

In comparison, `v-show` is much simpler - the element is always rendered regardless of initial condition, with CSS-based toggling.

Generally speaking, `v-if` has higher toggle costs while `v-show` has higher initial render costs. So prefer `v-show` if you need to toggle something very often, and prefer `v-if` if the condition is unlikely to change at runtime.

### `v-if` with `v-for`

When `v-if` and `v-for` are both used on the same element, `v-if` will be evaluated first. See the [list rendering guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/list#v-for-with-v-if) for details.

> **Note:**
It's **not** recommended to use `v-if` and `v-for` on the same element due to implicit precedence. Refer to [list rendering guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/list#v-for-with-v-if) for details.

## List Rendering

> **Source:** [List Rendering](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

### `v-for`

We can use the `v-for` directive to render a list of items based on an array. The `v-for` directive requires a special syntax in the form of `item in items`, where `items` is the source data array and `item` is an **alias** for the array element being iterated on:

```js
const items = ref([{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }])
```

```vue-html
<li v-for="item in items">
  {{ item.message }}
</li>
```

Inside the `v-for` scope, template expressions have access to all parent scope properties. In addition, `v-for` also supports an optional second alias for the index of the current item:

```js
const parentMessage = ref('Parent')
const items = ref([{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }])
```

```vue-html
<li v-for="(item, index) in items">
  {{ parentMessage }} - {{ index }} - {{ item.message }}
</li>
```

<script setup>
const parentMessage = 'Parent'
const items = [{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }]
</script>

  <li v-for="(item, index) in items">
    {{ parentMessage }} - {{ index }} - {{ item.message }}
  </li>

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpdTsuqwjAQ/ZVDNlFQu5d64bpwJ7g3LopOJdAmIRlFCPl3p60PcDWcM+eV1X8Iq/uN1FrV6RxtYCTiW/gzzvbBR0ZGpBYFbfQ9tEi1ccadvUuM0ERyvKeUmithMyhn+jCSev4WWaY+vZ7HjH5Sr6F33muUhTR8uW0ThTuJua6mPbJEgGSErmEaENedxX3Z+rgxajbEL2DdhR5zOVOdUSIEDOf8M7IULCHsaPgiMa1eK4QcS6rOSkhdfapVeQLQEWnH)

The variable scoping of `v-for` is similar to the following JavaScript:

```js
const parentMessage = 'Parent'
const items = [
  /* ... */
]

items.forEach((item, index) => {
  // has access to outer scope `parentMessage`
  // but `item` and `index` are only available in here
  console.log(parentMessage, item.message, index)
})
```

Notice how the `v-for` value matches the function signature of the `forEach` callback. In fact, you can use destructuring on the `v-for` item alias similar to destructuring function arguments:

```vue-html
<li v-for="{ message } in items">
  {{ message }}
</li>

<!-- with index alias -->
<li v-for="({ message }, index) in items">
  {{ message }} {{ index }}
</li>
```

For nested `v-for`, scoping also works similar to nested functions. Each `v-for` scope has access to parent scopes:

```vue-html
<li v-for="item in items">
  <span v-for="childItem in item.children">
    {{ item.message }} {{ childItem }}
  </span>
</li>
```

You can also use `of` as the delimiter instead of `in`, so that it is closer to JavaScript's syntax for iterators:

```vue-html

```

### `v-for` with an Object

You can also use `v-for` to iterate through the properties of an object. The iteration order will be based on the result of calling `Object.values()` on the object:

```js
const myObject = reactive({
  title: 'How to do lists in Vue',
  author: 'Jane Doe',
  publishedAt: '2016-04-10'
})
```

```vue-html
<ul>
  <li v-for="value in myObject">
    {{ value }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

You can also provide a second alias for the property's name (a.k.a. key):

```vue-html
<li v-for="(value, key) in myObject">
  {{ key }}: {{ value }}
</li>
```

And another for the index:

```vue-html
<li v-for="(value, key, index) in myObject">
  {{ index }}. {{ key }}: {{ value }}
</li>
```

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jjFvgzAQhf/KE0sSCQKpqg7IqRSpQ9WlWycvBC6KW2NbcKaNEP+9B7Tx4nt33917Y3IKYT9ESspE9XVnAqMnjuFZO9MG3zFGdFTVbAbChEvnW2yE32inXe1dz2hv7+dPqhnHO7kdtQPYsKUSm1f/DfZoPKzpuYdx+JAL6cxUka++E+itcoQX/9cO8SzslZoTy+yhODxlxWN2KMR22mmn8jWrpBTB1AZbMc2KVbTyQ56yBkN28d1RJ9uhspFSfNEtFf+GfnZzjP/oOll2NQPjuM4xTftZyIaU5VwuN0SsqMqtWZxUvliq/J4jmX4BTCp08A==)

### `v-for` with a Range

`v-for` can also take an integer. In this case it will repeat the template that many times, based on a range of `1...n`.

```vue-html
<span v-for="n in 10">{{ n }}</span>
```

Note here `n` starts with an initial value of `1` instead of `0`.

### `v-for` on `<template>`

Similar to template `v-if`, you can also use a `<template>` tag with `v-for` to render a block of multiple elements. For example:

```vue-html
<ul>
  <template v-for="item in items">
    <li>{{ item.msg }}</li>
    <li class="divider" role="presentation"></li>
  </template>
</ul>
```

### `v-for` with `v-if`

When they exist on the same node, `v-if` has a higher priority than `v-for`. That means the `v-if` condition will not have access to variables from the scope of the `v-for`:

```vue-html
<!--
This will throw an error because property "todo"
is not defined on instance.
-->
<li v-for="todo in todos" v-if="!todo.isComplete">
  {{ todo.name }}
</li>
```

This can be fixed by moving `v-for` to a wrapping `<template>` tag (which is also more explicit):

```vue-html
<template v-for="todo in todos">
  <li v-if="!todo.isComplete">
    {{ todo.name }}
  </li>
</template>
```

> **Note:**
It's **not** recommended to use `v-if` and `v-for` on the same element due to implicit precedence.

There are two common cases where this can be tempting:

- To filter items in a list (e.g. `v-for="user in users" v-if="user.isActive"`). In these cases, replace `users` with a new computed property that returns your filtered list (e.g. `activeUsers`).

- To avoid rendering a list if it should be hidden (e.g. `v-for="user in users" v-if="shouldShowUsers"`). In these cases, move the `v-if` to a container element (e.g. `ul`, `ol`).

### Maintaining State with `key`

When Vue is updating a list of elements rendered with `v-for`, by default it uses an "in-place patch" strategy. If the order of the data items has changed, instead of moving the DOM elements to match the order of the items, Vue will patch each element in-place and make sure it reflects what should be rendered at that particular index.

This default mode is efficient, but **only suitable when your list render output does not rely on child component state or temporary DOM state (e.g. form input values)**.

To give Vue a hint so that it can track each node's identity, and thus reuse and reorder existing elements, you need to provide a unique `key` attribute for each item:

```vue-html

  <!-- content -->

```

When using `<template v-for>`, the `key` should be placed on the `<template>` container:

```vue-html
<template v-for="todo in todos" :key="todo.name">
  <li>{{ todo.name }}</li>
</template>
```

> **Note:**
`key` here is a special attribute being bound with `v-bind`. It should not be confused with the property key variable when [using `v-for` with an object](#v-for-with-an-object).
> **Is Recommended To Provide A `Key` Attribute With `V-For` Whenever Possible, Unless The Iterated Dom Content Is Simple (I.E. Contains No Components Or Stateful Dom Elements), Or You Are Intentionally Relying On The Default Behavior For Performance Gains.:**

The `key` binding expects primitive values - i.e. strings and numbers. Do not use objects as `v-for` keys. For detailed usage of the `key` attribute, please see the [`key` API documentation](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-special-attributes#key).

### `v-for` with a Component

> This section assumes knowledge of [Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics). Feel free to skip it and come back later.

You can directly use `v-for` on a component, like any normal element (don't forget to provide a `key`):

```vue-html
<MyComponent v-for="item in items" :key="item.id" />
```

However, this won't automatically pass any data to the component, because components have isolated scopes of their own. In order to pass the iterated data into the component, we should also use props:

```vue-html
<MyComponent
  v-for="(item, index) in items"
  :item="item"
  :index="index"
  :key="item.id"
/>
```

The reason for not automatically injecting `item` into the component is because that makes the component tightly coupled to how `v-for` works. Being explicit about where its data comes from makes the component reusable in other situations.

### Array Change Detection

#### Mutation Methods

Vue is able to detect when a reactive array's mutation methods are called and trigger necessary updates. These mutation methods are:

- `push()`
- `pop()`
- `shift()`
- `unshift()`
- `splice()`
- `sort()`
- `reverse()`

#### Replacing an Array

Mutation methods, as the name suggests, mutate the original array they are called on. In comparison, there are also non-mutating methods, e.g. `filter()`, `concat()` and `slice()`, which do not mutate the original array but **always return a new array**. When working with non-mutating methods, we should replace the old array with the new one:

```js
// `items` is a ref with array value
items.value = items.value.filter((item) => item.message.match(/Foo/))
```

You might think this will cause Vue to throw away the existing DOM and re-render the entire list - luckily, that is not the case. Vue implements some smart heuristics to maximize DOM element reuse, so replacing an array with another array containing overlapping objects is a very efficient operation.

### Displaying Filtered/Sorted Results

Sometimes we want to display a filtered or sorted version of an array without actually mutating or resetting the original data. In this case, you can create a computed property that returns the filtered or sorted array.

For example:

```js
const numbers = ref([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

const evenNumbers = computed(() => {
  return numbers.value.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0)
})
```

```vue-html
<li v-for="n in evenNumbers">{{ n }}</li>
```

In situations where computed properties are not feasible (e.g. inside nested `v-for` loops), you can use a method:

```js
const sets = ref([
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
])

function even(numbers) {
  return numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0)
}
```

```vue-html
<ul v-for="numbers in sets">
  <li v-for="n in even(numbers)">{{ n }}</li>
</ul>
```

Be careful with `reverse()` and `sort()` in a computed property! These two methods will mutate the original array, which should be avoided in computed getters. Create a copy of the original array before calling these methods:

```diff
- return numbers.reverse()
+ return [...numbers].reverse()
```

## Event Handling

> **Source:** [Event Handling](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/event-handling.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

### Listening to Events

We can use the `v-on` directive, which we typically shorten to the `@` symbol, to listen to DOM events and run some JavaScript when they're triggered. The usage would be `v-on:click="handler"` or with the shortcut, `@click="handler"`.

The handler value can be one of the following:

1. **Inline handlers:** Inline JavaScript to be executed when the event is triggered (similar to the native `onclick` attribute).

2. **Method handlers:** A property name or path that points to a method defined on the component.

### Inline Handlers

Inline handlers are typically used in simple cases, for example:

```js
const count = ref(0)
```

```vue-html
<button @click="count++">Add 1</button>
<p>Count is: {{ count }}</p>
```

### Method Handlers

The logic for many event handlers will be more complex though, and likely isn't feasible with inline handlers. That's why `v-on` can also accept the name or path of a component method you'd like to call.

For example:

```js
const name = ref('Vue.js')

function greet(event) {
  alert(`Hello ${name.value}!`)
  // `event` is the native DOM event
  if (event) {
    alert(event.target.tagName)
  }
}
```

```vue-html
<!-- `greet` is the name of the method defined above -->
<button @click="greet">Greet</button>
```

A method handler automatically receives the native DOM Event object that triggers it - in the example above, we are able to access the element dispatching the event via `event.target`.

See also: [Typing Event Handlers](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-event-handlers) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

#### Method vs. Inline Detection

The template compiler detects method handlers by checking whether the `v-on` value string is a valid JavaScript identifier or property access path. For example, `foo`, `foo.bar` and `foo['bar']` are treated as method handlers, while `foo()` and `count++` are treated as inline handlers.

### Calling Methods in Inline Handlers

Instead of binding directly to a method name, we can also call methods in an inline handler. This allows us to pass the method custom arguments instead of the native event:

```js
function say(message) {
  alert(message)
}
```

```vue-html
<button @click="say('hello')">Say hello</button>
<button @click="say('bye')">Say bye</button>
```

### Accessing Event Argument in Inline Handlers

Sometimes we also need to access the original DOM event in an inline handler. You can pass it into a method using the special `$event` variable, or use an inline arrow function:

```vue-html
<!-- using $event special variable -->
<button @click="warn('Form cannot be submitted yet.', $event)">
  Submit
</button>

<!-- using inline arrow function -->
<button @click="(event) => warn('Form cannot be submitted yet.', event)">
  Submit
</button>
```

```js
function warn(message, event) {
  // now we have access to the native event
  if (event) {
    event.preventDefault()
  }
  alert(message)
}
```

### Event Modifiers

It is a very common need to call `event.preventDefault()` or `event.stopPropagation()` inside event handlers. Although we can do this easily inside methods, it would be better if the methods can be purely about data logic rather than having to deal with DOM event details.

To address this problem, Vue provides **event modifiers** for `v-on`. Recall that modifiers are directive postfixes denoted by a dot.

- `.stop`
- `.prevent`
- `.self`
- `.capture`
- `.once`
- `.passive`

```vue-html
<!-- the click event's propagation will be stopped -->
<a @click.stop="doThis"></a>

<!-- the submit event will no longer reload the page -->
<form @submit.prevent="onSubmit"></form>

<!-- modifiers can be chained -->
<a @click.stop.prevent="doThat"></a>

<!-- just the modifier -->
<form @submit.prevent></form>

<!-- only trigger handler if event.target is the element itself -->
<!-- i.e. not from a child element -->
...
```

> **Order Matters When Using Modifiers Because The Relevant Code Is Generated In The Same Order. Therefore Using `@Click.Prevent.Self` Will Prevent **Click'S Default Action On The Element Itself And Its Children**, While `@Click.Self.Prevent` Will Only Prevent Click'S Default Action On The Element Itself.:**
> **`.Capture`, `.Once`, And `.Passive` Modifiers Mirror The [Options Of The Native `Addeventlistener` Method](https://vuejs.org/guide/Https://Developer.Mozilla.Org/En-Us/Docs/Web/Api/Eventtarget/Addeventlistener#Options)::**

```vue-html
<!-- use capture mode when adding the event listener     -->
<!-- i.e. an event targeting an inner element is handled -->
<!-- here before being handled by that element           -->
...

<!-- the click event will be triggered at most once -->
<a @click.once="doThis"></a>

<!-- the scroll event's default behavior (scrolling) will happen -->
<!-- immediately, instead of waiting for `onScroll` to complete  -->
<!-- in case it contains `event.preventDefault()`                -->
...
```

The `.passive` modifier is typically used with touch event listeners for [improving performance on mobile devices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#improving_scroll_performance_using_passive_listeners).

> **Do Not Use `.Passive` And `.Prevent` Together, Because `.Passive` Already Indicates To The Browser That You _Do Not_ Intend To Prevent The Event'S Default Behavior, And You Will Likely See A Warning From The Browser If You Do So.:**

### Key Modifiers

When listening for keyboard events, we often need to check for specific keys. Vue allows adding key modifiers for `v-on` or `@` when listening for key events:

```vue-html
<!-- only call `submit` when the `key` is `Enter` -->
<input @keyup.enter="submit" />
```

You can directly use any valid key names exposed via [`KeyboardEvent.key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values) as modifiers by converting them to kebab-case.

```vue-html
<input @keyup.page-down="onPageDown" />
```

In the above example, the handler will only be called if `$event.key` is equal to `'PageDown'`.

#### Key Aliases

Vue provides aliases for the most commonly used keys:

- `.enter`
- `.tab`
- `.delete` (captures both "Delete" and "Backspace" keys)
- `.esc`
- `.space`
- `.up`
- `.down`
- `.left`
- `.right`

#### System Modifier Keys

You can use the following modifiers to trigger mouse or keyboard event listeners only when the corresponding modifier key is pressed:

- `.ctrl`
- `.alt`
- `.shift`
- `.meta`

> **Note:**
On Macintosh keyboards, meta is the command key (⌘). On Windows keyboards, meta is the Windows key (⊞). On Sun Microsystems keyboards, meta is marked as a solid diamond (◆). On certain keyboards, specifically MIT and Lisp machine keyboards and successors, such as the Knight keyboard, space-cadet keyboard, meta is labeled “META”. On Symbolics keyboards, meta is labeled “META” or “Meta”.
> **Example::**

```vue-html
<!-- Alt + Enter -->
<input @keyup.alt.enter="clear" />

<!-- Ctrl + Click -->
Do something
```

> **Note That Modifier Keys Are Different From Regular Keys And When Used With `Keyup` Events, They Have To Be Pressed When The Event Is Emitted. In Other Words, `Keyup.Ctrl` Will Only Trigger If You Release A Key While Holding Down `Ctrl`. It Won'T Trigger If You Release The `Ctrl` Key Alone.:**

#### `.exact` Modifier

The `.exact` modifier allows control of the exact combination of system modifiers needed to trigger an event.

```vue-html
<!-- this will fire even if Alt or Shift is also pressed -->
<button @click.ctrl="onClick">A</button>

<!-- this will only fire when Ctrl and no other keys are pressed -->
<button @click.ctrl.exact="onCtrlClick">A</button>

<!-- this will only fire when no system modifiers are pressed -->
<button @click.exact="onClick">A</button>
```

### Mouse Button Modifiers

- `.left`
- `.right`
- `.middle`

These modifiers restrict the handler to events triggered by a specific mouse button.

Note, however, that `.left`, `.right`, and `.middle` modifier names are based on the typical right-handed mouse layout, but in fact represent "main", "secondary", and "auxiliary" pointing device event triggers, respectively, and not the actual physical buttons. So that for a left-handed mouse layout the "main" button might physically be the right one but would trigger the `.left` modifier handler. Or a trackpad might trigger the `.left` handler with a one-finger tap, the `.right` handler with a two-finger tap, and the `.middle` handler with a three-finger tap. Similarly, other devices and event sources generating "mouse" events might have trigger modes that are not related to "left" and "right" whatsoever.

## Form Input Bindings

> **Source:** [Form Input Bindings](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/forms.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const message = ref('')
const multilineText = ref('')
const checked = ref(false)
const checkedNames = ref([])
const picked = ref('')
const selected = ref('')
const multiSelected = ref([])
const dynamicSelected = ref('A')
const options = ref([
  { text: 'One', value: 'A' },
  { text: 'Two', value: 'B' },
  { text: 'Three', value: 'C' }
])
</script>

### Form Input Bindings

When dealing with forms on the frontend, we often need to sync the state of form input elements with corresponding state in JavaScript. It can be cumbersome to manually wire up value bindings and change event listeners:

```vue-html
<input
  :value="text"
  @input="event => text = event.target.value">
```

The `v-model` directive helps us simplify the above to:

```vue-html
<input v-model="text">
```

In addition, `v-model` can be used on inputs of different types, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` elements. It automatically expands to different DOM property and event pairs based on the element it is used on:

- `<input>` with text types and `<textarea>` elements use `value` property and `input` event;
- `<input type="checkbox">` and `<input type="radio">` use `checked` property and `change` event;
- `<select>` uses `value` as a prop and `change` as an event.

> **Note:**
`v-model` will ignore the initial `value`, `checked` or `selected` attributes found on any form elements. It will always treat the current bound JavaScript state as the source of truth. You should declare the initial value on the JavaScript side, using <span class="options-api">the [`data`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state.html#data) option</span><span class="composition-api">[reactivity APIs](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#reactivity-api-core)</span>.

#### Basic Usage

##### Text

```vue-html
<p>Message is: {{ message }}</p>
<input v-model="message" placeholder="edit me" />
```

  <p>Message is: {{ message }}</p>
  <input v-model="message" placeholder="edit me" />

<span id="vmodel-ime-tip"></span>
> **Note:**
For languages that require an [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.), you'll notice that `v-model` doesn't get updated during IME composition. If you want to respond to these updates as well, use your own `input` event listener and `value` binding instead of using `v-model`.

##### Multiline Text

```vue-html
<span>Multiline message is:</span>
<p style="white-space: pre-line;">{{ message }}</p>
<textarea v-model="message" placeholder="add multiple lines"></textarea>
```

  <span>Multiline message is:</span>
  <p style="white-space: pre-line;">{{ multilineText }}</p>
  <textarea v-model="multilineText" placeholder="add multiple lines"></textarea>

Note that interpolation inside `<textarea>` won't work. Use `v-model` instead.

```vue-html
<!-- bad -->
<textarea>{{ text }}</textarea>

<!-- good -->
<textarea v-model="text"></textarea>
```

##### Checkbox

Single checkbox, boolean value:

```vue-html
<input type="checkbox" id="checkbox" v-model="checked" />
<label for="checkbox">{{ checked }}</label>
```

  <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-demo" v-model="checked" />
  <label for="checkbox-demo">{{ checked }}</label>

We can also bind multiple checkboxes to the same array or [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) value:

```js
const checkedNames = ref([])
```

```vue-html
Checked names: {{ checkedNames }}

<input type="checkbox" id="jack" value="Jack" v-model="checkedNames" />
<label for="jack">Jack</label>

<input type="checkbox" id="john" value="John" v-model="checkedNames" />
<label for="john">John</label>

<input type="checkbox" id="mike" value="Mike" v-model="checkedNames" />
<label for="mike">Mike</label>
```

  Checked names: {{ checkedNames }}

  <input type="checkbox" id="demo-jack" value="Jack" v-model="checkedNames" />
  <label for="demo-jack">Jack</label>

  <input type="checkbox" id="demo-john" value="John" v-model="checkedNames" />
  <label for="demo-john">John</label>

  <input type="checkbox" id="demo-mike" value="Mike" v-model="checkedNames" />
  <label for="demo-mike">Mike</label>

In this case, the `checkedNames` array will always contain the values from the currently checked boxes.

> **Note:**
If the initial value of your `v-model` expression does not match any of the options, the `<select>` element will render in an "unselected" state. On iOS this will cause the user not being able to select the first item because iOS does not fire a change event in this case. It is therefore recommended to provide a disabled option with an empty value, as demonstrated in the example above.

#### Value Bindings

For radio, checkbox and select options, the `v-model` binding values are usually static strings (or booleans for checkbox):

```vue-html
<!-- `picked` is a string "a" when checked -->
<input type="radio" v-model="picked" value="a" />

<!-- `toggle` is either true or false -->
<input type="checkbox" v-model="toggle" />

<!-- `selected` is a string "abc" when the first option is selected -->
<select v-model="selected">
  <option value="abc">ABC</option>
</select>
```

But sometimes we may want to bind the value to a dynamic property on the current active instance. We can use `v-bind` to achieve that. In addition, using `v-bind` allows us to bind the input value to non-string values.

##### Checkbox

```vue-html
<input
  type="checkbox"
  v-model="toggle"
  true-value="yes"
  false-value="no" />
```

`true-value` and `false-value` are Vue-specific attributes that only work with `v-model`. Here the `toggle` property's value will be set to `'yes'` when the box is checked, and set to `'no'` when unchecked. You can also bind them to dynamic values using `v-bind`:

```vue-html
<input
  type="checkbox"
  v-model="toggle"
  :true-value="dynamicTrueValue"
  :false-value="dynamicFalseValue" />
```

> **Tip:**
The `true-value` and `false-value` attributes don't affect the input's `value` attribute, because browsers don't include unchecked boxes in form submissions. To guarantee that one of two values is submitted in a form (e.g. "yes" or "no"), use radio inputs instead.

##### Radio

```vue-html
<input type="radio" v-model="pick" :value="first" />
<input type="radio" v-model="pick" :value="second" />
```

`pick` will be set to the value of `first` when the first radio input is checked, and set to the value of `second` when the second one is checked.

##### Select Options

```vue-html
<select v-model="selected">
  <!-- inline object literal -->
  <option :value="{ number: 123 }">123</option>
</select>
```

`v-model` supports value bindings of non-string values as well! In the above example, when the option is selected, `selected` will be set to the object literal value of `{ number: 123 }`.

#### Modifiers

##### `.lazy`

By default, `v-model` syncs the input with the data after each `input` event (with the exception of IME composition as [stated above](#vmodel-ime-tip)). You can add the `lazy` modifier to instead sync after `change` events:

```vue-html
<!-- synced after "change" instead of "input" -->
<input v-model.lazy="msg" />
```

##### `.number`

If you want user input to be automatically typecast as a number, you can add the `number` modifier to your `v-model` managed inputs:

```vue-html
<input v-model.number="age" />
```

If the value cannot be parsed with `parseFloat()`, then the original (string) value is used instead. In particular, if the input is empty (for instance after the user clearing the input field), an empty string is returned. This behavior differs from the [DOM property `valueAsNumber`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement#valueasnumber).

The `number` modifier is applied automatically if the input has `type="number"`.

##### `.trim`

If you want whitespace from user input to be trimmed automatically, you can add the `trim` modifier to your `v-model`-managed inputs:

```vue-html
<input v-model.trim="msg" />
```

#### `v-model` with Components

> If you're not yet familiar with Vue's components, you can skip this for now.

HTML's built-in input types won't always meet your needs. Fortunately, Vue components allow you to build reusable inputs with completely customized behavior. These inputs even work with `v-model`! To learn more, read about [Usage with `v-model`](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model) in the Components guide.

## Watchers

> **Source:** [Watchers](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

### Basic Example

Computed properties allow us to declaratively compute derived values. However, there are cases where we need to perform "side effects" in reaction to state changes - for example, mutating the DOM, or changing another piece of state based on the result of an async operation.

With Composition API, we can use the [`watch` function](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core#watch) to trigger a callback whenever a piece of reactive state changes:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, watch } from 'vue'

const question = ref('')
const answer = ref('Questions usually contain a question mark. ;-)')
const loading = ref(false)

// watch works directly on a ref
watch(question, async (newQuestion, oldQuestion) => {
  if (newQuestion.includes('?')) {
    loading.value = true
    answer.value = 'Thinking...'
    try {
      const res = await fetch('https://yesno.wtf/api')
      answer.value = (await res.json()).answer
    } catch (error) {
      answer.value = 'Error! Could not reach the API. ' + error
    } finally {
      loading.value = false
    }
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <p>
    Ask a yes/no question:
    <input v-model="question" :disabled="loading" />
  </p>
  <p>{{ answer }}</p>
</template>
```

#### Watch Source Types

`watch`'s first argument can be different types of reactive "sources": it can be a ref (including computed refs), a reactive object, a [getter function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get#description), or an array of multiple sources:

```js
const x = ref(0)
const y = ref(0)

// single ref
watch(x, (newX) => {
  console.log(`x is ${newX}`)
})

// getter
watch(
  () => x.value + y.value,
  (sum) => {
    console.log(`sum of x + y is: ${sum}`)
  }
)

// array of multiple sources
watch([x, () => y.value], ([newX, newY]) => {
  console.log(`x is ${newX} and y is ${newY}`)
})
```

Do note that you can't watch a property of a reactive object like this:

```js
const obj = reactive({ count: 0 })

// this won't work because we are passing a number to watch()
watch(obj.count, (count) => {
  console.log(`Count is: ${count}`)
})
```

Instead, use a getter:

```js
// instead, use a getter:
watch(
  () => obj.count,
  (count) => {
    console.log(`Count is: ${count}`)
  }
)
```

### Deep Watchers

When you call `watch()` directly on a reactive object, it will implicitly create a deep watcher - the callback will be triggered on all nested mutations:

```js
const obj = reactive({ count: 0 })

watch(obj, (newValue, oldValue) => {
  // fires on nested property mutations
  // Note: `newValue` will be equal to `oldValue` here
  // because they both point to the same object!
})

obj.count++
```

This should be differentiated with a getter that returns a reactive object - in the latter case, the callback will only fire if the getter returns a different object:

```js
watch(
  () => state.someObject,
  () => {
    // fires only when state.someObject is replaced
  }
)
```

You can, however, force the second case into a deep watcher by explicitly using the `deep` option:

```js
watch(
  () => state.someObject,
  (newValue, oldValue) => {
    // Note: `newValue` will be equal to `oldValue` here
    // *unless* state.someObject has been replaced
  },
  { deep: true }
)
```

In Vue 3.5+, the `deep` option can also be a number indicating the max traversal depth - i.e. how many levels should Vue traverse an object's nested properties.

> **Use With Caution:**
Deep watch requires traversing all nested properties in the watched object, and can be expensive when used on large data structures. Use it only when necessary and beware of the performance implications.

### Eager Watchers

`watch` is lazy by default: the callback won't be called until the watched source has changed. But in some cases we may want the same callback logic to be run eagerly - for example, we may want to fetch some initial data, and then re-fetch the data whenever relevant state changes.

We can force a watcher's callback to be executed immediately by passing the `immediate: true` option:

```js
watch(
  source,
  (newValue, oldValue) => {
    // executed immediately, then again when `source` changes
  },
  { immediate: true }
)
```

### Once Watchers

- Only supported in 3.4+

Watcher's callback will execute whenever the watched source changes. If you want the callback to trigger only once when the source changes, use the `once: true` option.

```js
watch(
  source,
  (newValue, oldValue) => {
    // when `source` changes, triggers only once
  },
  { once: true }
)
```

### `watchEffect()` \*\*

It is common for the watcher callback to use exactly the same reactive state as the source. For example, consider the following code, which uses a watcher to load a remote resource whenever the `todoId` ref changes:

```js
const todoId = ref(1)
const data = ref(null)

watch(
  todoId,
  async () => {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${todoId.value}`
    )
    data.value = await response.json()
  },
  { immediate: true }
)
```

In particular, notice how the watcher uses `todoId` twice, once as the source and then again inside the callback.

This can be simplified with [`watchEffect()`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core#watcheffect). `watchEffect()` allows us to track the callback's reactive dependencies automatically. The watcher above can be rewritten as:

```js
watchEffect(async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${todoId.value}`
  )
  data.value = await response.json()
})
```

Here, the callback will run immediately, there's no need to specify `immediate: true`. During its execution, it will automatically track `todoId.value` as a dependency (similar to computed properties). Whenever `todoId.value` changes, the callback will be run again. With `watchEffect()`, we no longer need to pass `todoId` explicitly as the source value.

You can check out [this example](https://vuejs.org/examples/#fetching-data) of `watchEffect()` and reactive data-fetching in action.

For examples like these, with only one dependency, the benefit of `watchEffect()` is relatively small. But for watchers that have multiple dependencies, using `watchEffect()` removes the burden of having to maintain the list of dependencies manually. In addition, if you need to watch several properties in a nested data structure, `watchEffect()` may prove more efficient than a deep watcher, as it will only track the properties that are used in the callback, rather than recursively tracking all of them.

> **`Watcheffect` Only Tracks Dependencies During Its **Synchronous** Execution. When Using It With An Async Callback, Only Properties Accessed Before The First `Await` Tick Will Be Tracked.:**

#### `watch` vs. `watchEffect`

`watch` and `watchEffect` both allow us to reactively perform side effects. Their main difference is the way they track their reactive dependencies:

- `watch` only tracks the explicitly watched source. It won't track anything accessed inside the callback. In addition, the callback only triggers when the source has actually changed. `watch` separates dependency tracking from the side effect, giving us more precise control over when the callback should fire.

- `watchEffect`, on the other hand, combines dependency tracking and side effect into one phase. It automatically tracks every reactive property accessed during its synchronous execution. This is more convenient and typically results in terser code, but makes its reactive dependencies less explicit.

### Side Effect Cleanup

Sometimes we may perform side effects, e.g. asynchronous requests, in a watcher:

```js
watch(id, (newId) => {
  fetch(`/api/${newId}`).then(() => {
    // callback logic
  })
})
```

But what if `id` changes before the request completes? When the previous request completes, it will still fire the callback with an ID value that is already stale. Ideally, we want to be able to cancel the stale request when `id` changes to a new value.

We can use the [`onWatcherCleanup()`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core#onwatchercleanup) <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> API to register a cleanup function that will be called when the watcher is invalidated and is about to re-run:

```js
import { watch, onWatcherCleanup } from 'vue'

watch(id, (newId) => {
  const controller = new AbortController()

  fetch(`/api/${newId}`, { signal: controller.signal }).then(() => {
    // callback logic
  })

  onWatcherCleanup(() => {
    // abort stale request
    controller.abort()
  })
})
```

Note that `onWatcherCleanup` is only supported in Vue 3.5+ and must be called during the synchronous execution of a `watchEffect` effect function or `watch` callback function: you cannot call it after an `await` statement in an async function.

Alternatively, an `onCleanup` function is also passed to watcher callbacks as the 3rd argument<span class="composition-api">, and to the `watchEffect` effect function as the first argument</span>:

```js
watch(id, (newId, oldId, onCleanup) => {
  // ...
  onCleanup(() => {
    // cleanup logic
  })
})

watchEffect((onCleanup) => {
  // ...
  onCleanup(() => {
    // cleanup logic
  })
})
```

`onCleanup` passed via function argument is bound to the watcher instance so it is not subject to the synchronous constraint of `onWatcherCleanup`.

### Callback Flush Timing

When you mutate reactive state, it may trigger both Vue component updates and watcher callbacks created by you.

Similar to component updates, user-created watcher callbacks are batched to avoid duplicate invocations. For example, we probably don't want a watcher to fire a thousand times if we synchronously push a thousand items into an array being watched.

By default, a watcher's callback is called **after** parent component updates (if any), and **before** the owner component's DOM updates. This means if you attempt to access the owner component's own DOM inside a watcher callback, the DOM will be in a pre-update state.

#### Post Watchers

If you want to access the owner component's DOM in a watcher callback **after** Vue has updated it, you need to specify the `flush: 'post'` option:

```js{2,6}
watch(source, callback, {
  flush: 'post'
})

watchEffect(callback, {
  flush: 'post'
})
```

Post-flush `watchEffect()` also has a convenience alias, `watchPostEffect()`:

```js
import { watchPostEffect } from 'vue'

watchPostEffect(() => {
  /* executed after Vue updates */
})
```

#### Sync Watchers

It's also possible to create a watcher that fires synchronously, before any Vue-managed updates:

```js{2,6}
watch(source, callback, {
  flush: 'sync'
})

watchEffect(callback, {
  flush: 'sync'
})
```

Sync `watchEffect()` also has a convenience alias, `watchSyncEffect()`:

```js
import { watchSyncEffect } from 'vue'

watchSyncEffect(() => {
  /* executed synchronously upon reactive data change */
})
```

> **Use With Caution:**
Sync watchers do not have batching and triggers every time a reactive mutation is detected. It's ok to use them to watch simple boolean values, but avoid using them on data sources that might be synchronously mutated many times, e.g. arrays.

### Stopping a Watcher

Watchers declared synchronously inside `setup()` or `<script setup>` are bound to the owner component instance, and will be automatically stopped when the owner component is unmounted. In most cases, you don't need to worry about stopping the watcher yourself.

The key here is that the watcher must be created **synchronously**: if the watcher is created in an async callback, it won't be bound to the owner component and must be stopped manually to avoid memory leaks. Here's an example:

```vue
<script setup>
import { watchEffect } from 'vue'

// this one will be automatically stopped
watchEffect(() => {})

// ...this one will not!
setTimeout(() => {
  watchEffect(() => {})
}, 100)
</script>
```

To manually stop a watcher, use the returned handle function. This works for both `watch` and `watchEffect`:

```js
const unwatch = watchEffect(() => {})

// ...later, when no longer needed
unwatch()
```

Note that there should be very few cases where you need to create watchers asynchronously, and synchronous creation should be preferred whenever possible. If you need to wait for some async data, you can make your watch logic conditional instead:

```js
// data to be loaded asynchronously
const data = ref(null)

watchEffect(() => {
  if (data.value) {
    // do something when data is loaded
  }
})
```

## Template Refs

> **Source:** [Template Refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

While Vue's declarative rendering model abstracts away most of the direct DOM operations for you, there may still be cases where we need direct access to the underlying DOM elements. To achieve this, we can use the special `ref` attribute:

```vue-html
<input ref="input">
```

`ref` is a special attribute, similar to the `key` attribute discussed in the `v-for` chapter. It allows us to obtain a direct reference to a specific DOM element or child component instance after it's mounted. This may be useful when you want to, for example, programmatically focus an input on component mount, or initialize a 3rd party library on an element.

### Accessing the Refs

To obtain the reference with Composition API, we can use the [`useTemplateRef()`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-helpers#usetemplateref) <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> helper:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useTemplateRef, onMounted } from 'vue'

// the first argument must match the ref value in the template
const input = useTemplateRef('my-input')

onMounted(() => {
  input.value.focus()
})
</script>

<template>
  <input ref="my-input" />
</template>
```

When using TypeScript, Vue's IDE support and `vue-tsc` will automatically infer the type of `input.value` based on what element or component the matching `ref` attribute is used on.

<details>
<summary>Usage before 3.5</summary>

In versions before 3.5 where `useTemplateRef()` was not introduced, we need to declare a ref with a name that matches the template ref attribute's value:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

// declare a ref to hold the element reference
// the name must match template ref value
const input = ref(null)

onMounted(() => {
  input.value.focus()
})
</script>

<template>
  <input ref="input" />
</template>
```

If not using `<script setup>`, make sure to also return the ref from `setup()`:

```js{6}
export default {
  setup() {
    const input = ref(null)
    // ...
    return {
      input
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Note that you can only access the ref **after the component is mounted.** If you try to access <span class="options-api">`$refs.input`</span><span class="composition-api">`input`</span> in a template expression, it will be <span class="options-api">`undefined`</span><span class="composition-api">`null`</span> on the first render. This is because the element doesn't exist until after the first render!

If you are trying to watch the changes of a template ref, make sure to account for the case where the ref has `null` value:

```js
watchEffect(() => {
  if (input.value) {
    input.value.focus()
  } else {
    // not mounted yet, or the element was unmounted (e.g. by v-if)
  }
})
```

### Ref on Component

> This section assumes knowledge of [Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics). Feel free to skip it and come back later.

`ref` can also be used on a child component. In this case the reference will be that of a component instance:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useTemplateRef, onMounted } from 'vue'
import Child from './Child.vue'

const childRef = useTemplateRef('child')

onMounted(() => {
  // childRef.value will hold an instance of <Child />
})
</script>

<template>
  <Child ref="child" />
</template>
```

<details>
<summary>Usage before 3.5</summary>

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import Child from './Child.vue'

const child = ref(null)

onMounted(() => {
  // child.value will hold an instance of <Child />
})
</script>

<template>
  <Child ref="child" />
</template>
```

</details>

<span class="composition-api">If the child component is using Options API or not using `<script setup>`, the</span><span class="options-api">The</span> referenced instance will be identical to the child component's `this`, which means the parent component will have full access to every property and method of the child component. This makes it easy to create tightly coupled implementation details between the parent and the child, so component refs should be only used when absolutely needed - in most cases, you should try to implement parent / child interactions using the standard props and emit interfaces first.

An exception here is that components using `<script setup>` are **private by default**: a parent component referencing a child component using `<script setup>` won't be able to access anything unless the child component chooses to expose a public interface using the `defineExpose` macro:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const a = 1
const b = ref(2)

// Compiler macros, such as defineExpose, don't need to be imported
defineExpose({
  a,
  b
})
</script>
```

When a parent gets an instance of this component via template refs, the retrieved instance will be of the shape `{ a: number, b: number }` (refs are automatically unwrapped just like on normal instances).

Note that defineExpose must be called before any await operation. Otherwise, properties and methods exposed after the await operation will not be accessible.

See also: [Typing Component Template Refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-component-template-refs) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

### Refs inside `v-for`

> Requires v3.5 or above

When `ref` is used inside `v-for`, the corresponding ref should contain an Array value, which will be populated with the elements after mount:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, useTemplateRef, onMounted } from 'vue'

const list = ref([
  /* ... */
])

const itemRefs = useTemplateRef('items')

onMounted(() => console.log(itemRefs.value))
</script>

<template>
  <ul>
    <li v-for="item in list" ref="items">
      {{ item }}
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>
```

<details>
<summary>Usage before 3.5</summary>

In versions before 3.5 where `useTemplateRef()` was not introduced, we need to declare a ref with a name that matches the template ref attribute's value. The ref should also contain an array value:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

const list = ref([
  /* ... */
])

const itemRefs = ref([])

onMounted(() => console.log(itemRefs.value))
</script>

<template>
  <ul>
    <li v-for="item in list" ref="itemRefs">
      {{ item }}
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>
```

</details>

It should be noted that the ref array does **not** guarantee the same order as the source array.

### Function Refs

Instead of a string key, the `ref` attribute can also be bound to a function, which will be called on each component update and gives you full flexibility on where to store the element reference. The function receives the element reference as the first argument:

```vue-html
<input :ref="(el) => { /* assign el to a property or ref */ }">
```

Note we are using a dynamic `:ref` binding so we can pass it a function instead of a ref name string. When the element is unmounted, the argument will be `null`. You can, of course, use a method instead of an inline function.

## Lifecycle Hooks

> **Source:** [Lifecycle Hooks](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

Each Vue component instance goes through a series of initialization steps when it's created - for example, it needs to set up data observation, compile the template, mount the instance to the DOM, and update the DOM when data changes. Along the way, it also runs functions called lifecycle hooks, giving users the opportunity to add their own code at specific stages.

### Registering Lifecycle Hooks

For example, the <span class="composition-api">`onMounted`</span><span class="options-api">`mounted`</span> hook can be used to run code after the component has finished the initial rendering and created the DOM nodes:

```vue
<script setup>
import { onMounted } from 'vue'

onMounted(() => {
  console.log(`the component is now mounted.`)
})
</script>
```

There are also other hooks which will be called at different stages of the instance's lifecycle, with the most commonly used being <span class="composition-api">[`onMounted`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle#onmounted), [`onUpdated`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle#onupdated), and [`onUnmounted`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle#onunmounted).</span><span class="options-api">[`mounted`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-lifecycle#mounted), [`updated`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-lifecycle#updated), and [`unmounted`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-lifecycle#unmounted).</span>

When calling `onMounted`, Vue automatically associates the registered callback function with the current active component instance. This requires these hooks to be registered **synchronously** during component setup. For example, do not do this:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  onMounted(() => {
    // this won't work.
  })
}, 100)
```

Do note this doesn't mean that the call must be placed lexically inside `setup()` or `<script setup>`. `onMounted()` can be called in an external function as long as the call stack is synchronous and originates from within `setup()`.

### Lifecycle Diagram

Below is a diagram for the instance lifecycle. You don't need to fully understand everything going on right now, but as you learn and build more, it will be a useful reference.

<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/Xw3UeNMOralY6NV7gSjWdS/Vue-Lifecycle -->

Consult the <span class="composition-api">[Lifecycle Hooks API reference](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle)</span><span class="options-api">[Lifecycle Hooks API reference](https://vuejs.org/api/options-lifecycle)</span> for details on all lifecycle hooks and their respective use cases.

And that's the end of Vue's _Essentials_. Congratulations! There's still more to learn, but first, we recommend taking a break to play with Vue yourself - build something fun, or check out some of the [Examples](https://vuejs.org/examples/) if you haven't already.

Once you feel comfortable with the knowledge you've just digested, move on with the guide to learn more about components in depth.

## Components Basics

> **Source:** [Components Basics](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

  Watch an interactive video lesson on Scrimba

Components allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. It's common for an app to be organized into a tree of nested components:

<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/qa7WHDQRWuEZNRs7iZRZSI/components -->

This is very similar to how we nest native HTML elements, but Vue implements its own component model that allows us to encapsulate custom content and logic in each component. Vue also plays nicely with native Web Components. If you are curious about the relationship between Vue Components and native Web Components, [read more here](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components).

### Defining a Component

When using a build step, we typically define each Vue component in a dedicated file using the `.vue` extension - known as a [Single-File Component](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc) (SFC for short):

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">You clicked me {{ count }} times.</button>
</template>
```

When not using a build step, a Vue component can be defined as a plain JavaScript object containing Vue-specific options:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)
    return { count }
  },
  template: `
    <button @click="count++">
      You clicked me {{ count }} times.
    </button>`
  // Can also target an in-DOM template:
  // template: '#my-template-element'
}
```

The template is inlined as a JavaScript string here, which Vue will compile on the fly. You can also use an ID selector pointing to an element (usually native `<template>` elements) - Vue will use its content as the template source.

The example above defines a single component and exports it as the default export of a `.js` file, but you can use named exports to export multiple components from the same file.

### Using a Component

> **We Will Be Using Sfc Syntax For The Rest Of This Guide - The Concepts Around Components Are The Same Regardless Of Whether You Are Using A Build Step Or Not. The [Examples](https://vuejs.org/Examples/) Section Shows Component Usage In Both Scenarios.:**
> **Use A Child Component, We Need To Import It In The Parent Component. Assuming We Placed Our Counter Component Inside A File Called `Buttoncounter.Vue`, The Component Will Be Exposed As The File'S Default Export::**

```vue
<script setup>
import ButtonCounter from './ButtonCounter.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <h1>Here is a child component!</h1>
  <ButtonCounter />
</template>
```

With `<script setup>`, imported components are automatically made available to the template.

It's also possible to globally register a component, making it available to all components in a given app without having to import it. The pros and cons of global vs. local registration is discussed in the dedicated [Component Registration](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/registration) section.

Components can be reused as many times as you want:

```vue-html
<h1>Here are many child components!</h1>
<ButtonCounter />
<ButtonCounter />
<ButtonCounter />
```

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqVj91KAzEQhV/lmJsqlY3eSlr8ufEVhNys6ZQGNz8kE0GWfXez2SJUsdCLuZiZM9+ZM4qnGLvPQuJBqGySjYxMXOJWe+tiSIznwhz8SyieKWGfgsOqkyfTGbDSXsmFUG9rw+Ti0DPNHavD/faVEqGv5Xr/BXOwww4mVBNPnvOVklXTtKeO8qKhkj++4lb8+fL/mCMS7TEdAy6BtDfBZ65fVgA2s+L67uZMUEC9N0s8msGaj40W7Xa91qKtgbdQ0Ha0gyOM45E+TWDrKHeNIhfMr0DTN4U0me8=)

Notice that when clicking on the buttons, each one maintains its own, separate `count`. That's because each time you use a component, a new **instance** of it is created.

In SFCs, it's recommended to use `PascalCase` tag names for child components to differentiate from native HTML elements. Although native HTML tag names are case-insensitive, Vue SFC is a compiled format so we are able to use case-sensitive tag names in it. We are also able to use `/>` to close a tag.

If you are authoring your templates directly in a DOM (e.g. as the content of a native `<template>` element), the template will be subject to the browser's native HTML parsing behavior. In such cases, you will need to use `kebab-case` and explicit closing tags for components:

```vue-html
<!-- if this template is written in the DOM -->
<button-counter></button-counter>
<button-counter></button-counter>
<button-counter></button-counter>
```

See [in-DOM template parsing caveats](#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats) for more details.

### Passing Props

If we are building a blog, we will likely need a component representing a blog post. We want all the blog posts to share the same visual layout, but with different content. Such a component won't be useful unless you can pass data to it, such as the title and content of the specific post we want to display. That's where props come in.

Props are custom attributes you can register on a component. To pass a title to our blog post component, we must declare it in the list of props this component accepts, using the <span class="options-api">[`props`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state#props) option</span><span class="composition-api">[`defineProps`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits) macro</span>:

```vue
<script setup>
defineProps(['title'])
</script>

<template>
  <h4>{{ title }}</h4>
</template>
```

`defineProps` is a compile-time macro that is only available inside `<script setup>` and does not need to be explicitly imported. Declared props are automatically exposed to the template. `defineProps` also returns an object that contains all the props passed to the component, so that we can access them in JavaScript if needed:

```js
const props = defineProps(['title'])
console.log(props.title)
```

See also: [Typing Component Props](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-component-props) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

If you are not using `<script setup>`, props should be declared using the `props` option, and the props object will be passed to `setup()` as the first argument:

```js
export default {
  props: ['title'],
  setup(props) {
    console.log(props.title)
  }
}
```

A component can have as many props as you like and, by default, any value can be passed to any prop.

Once a prop is registered, you can pass data to it as a custom attribute, like this:

```vue-html
<BlogPost title="My journey with Vue" />
<BlogPost title="Blogging with Vue" />
<BlogPost title="Why Vue is so fun" />
```

In a typical app, however, you'll likely have an array of posts in your parent component:

```js
const posts = ref([
  { id: 1, title: 'My journey with Vue' },
  { id: 2, title: 'Blogging with Vue' },
  { id: 3, title: 'Why Vue is so fun' }
])
```

Then want to render a component for each one, using `v-for`:

```vue-html
<BlogPost
  v-for="post in posts"
  :key="post.id"
  :title="post.title"
 />
```

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9kU9PhDAUxL/KpBfWBCH+OZEuid5N9qSHrQezFKhC27RlDSF8d1tYQBP1+N78OpN5HciD1sm54yQj1J6M0A6Wu07nTIpWK+MwwPASI0qjWkQejVbpsVHVQVl30ZJ0WQRHjwFMnpT0gPZLi32w2h2DMEAUGW5iOOEaniF66vGuOiN5j0/hajx7B4zxxt5ubIiphKz+IO828qXugw5hYRXKTnqSydcrJmk61/VF/eB4q5s3x8Pk6FJjauDO16Uye0ZCBwg5d2EkkED2wfuLlogibMOTbMpf9tMwP8jpeiMfRdM1l8Tk+/F++Y6Cl0Lyg1Ha7o7R5Bn9WwSg9X0+DPMxMI409fPP1PELlVmwdQ==)

Notice how [`v-bind` syntax](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives#v-bind) (`:title="post.title"`) is used to pass dynamic prop values. This is especially useful when you don't know the exact content you're going to render ahead of time.

That's all you need to know about props for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on [Props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props).

### Listening to Events

As we develop our `` component, some features may require communicating back up to the parent. For example, we may decide to include an accessibility feature to enlarge the text of blog posts, while leaving the rest of the page at its default size.

In the parent, we can support this feature by adding a `postFontSize` <span class="options-api">data property</span><span class="composition-api">ref</span>:

```js{5}
const posts = ref([
  /* ... */
])

const postFontSize = ref(1)
```

Which can be used in the template to control the font size of all blog posts:

```vue-html{1,7}

  <BlogPost
    v-for="post in posts"
    :key="post.id"
    :title="post.title"
   />

```

Now let's add a button to the `` component's template:

```vue{5} [BlogPost.vue]
<!-- omitting <script> -->
<template>

    <h4>{{ title }}</h4>
    <button>Enlarge text</button>

</template>
```

The button doesn't do anything yet - we want clicking the button to communicate to the parent that it should enlarge the text of all posts. To solve this problem, components provide a custom events system. The parent can choose to listen to any event on the child component instance with `v-on` or `@`, just as we would with a native DOM event:

```vue-html{3}
<BlogPost
  ...
  @enlarge-text="postFontSize += 0.1"
 />
```

Then the child component can emit an event on itself by calling the built-in [**`$emit`** method](https://vuejs.org/api/component-instance#emit), passing the name of the event:

```vue{5} [BlogPost.vue]
<!-- omitting <script> -->
<template>

    <h4>{{ title }}</h4>
    <button @click="$emit('enlarge-text')">Enlarge text</button>

</template>
```

Thanks to the `@enlarge-text="postFontSize += 0.1"` listener, the parent will receive the event and update the value of `postFontSize`.

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)

We can optionally declare emitted events using the <span class="options-api">[`emits`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state#emits) option</span><span class="composition-api">[`defineEmits`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits) macro</span>:

```vue{3} [BlogPost.vue]
<script setup>
defineProps(['title'])
defineEmits(['enlarge-text'])
</script>
```

This documents all the events that a component emits and optionally [validates them](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events#events-validation). It also allows Vue to avoid implicitly applying them as native listeners to the child component's root element.

Similar to `defineProps`, `defineEmits` is only usable in `<script setup>` and doesn't need to be imported. It returns an `emit` function that is equivalent to the `$emit` method. It can be used to emit events in the `<script setup>` section of a component, where `$emit` isn't directly accessible:

```vue
<script setup>
const emit = defineEmits(['enlarge-text'])

emit('enlarge-text')
</script>
```

See also: [Typing Component Emits](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-component-emits) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

If you are not using `<script setup>`, you can declare emitted events using the `emits` option. You can access the `emit` function as a property of the setup context (passed to `setup()` as the second argument):

```js
export default {
  emits: ['enlarge-text'],
  setup(props, ctx) {
    ctx.emit('enlarge-text')
  }
}
```

That's all you need to know about custom component events for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on [Custom Events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events).

### Content Distribution with Slots

Just like with HTML elements, it's often useful to be able to pass content to a component, like this:

```vue-html
<AlertBox>
  Something bad happened.
</AlertBox>
```

Which might render something like:

> **This Is An Error For Demo Purposes:**
Something bad happened.
> **Can Be Achieved Using Vue'S Custom `<Slot>` Element::**

```vue{4} [AlertBox.vue]
<template>

    <strong>This is an Error for Demo Purposes</strong>
    <slot />

</template>

<style scoped>
.alert-box {
  /* ... */
}
</style>
```

As you'll see above, we use the `<slot>` as a placeholder where we want the content to go – and that's it. We're done!

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpVUEtOwzAQvcpgFt3QBBCqUAiRisQJ2GbjxG4a4Xis8aQKqnp37PyUyqv3mZn3fBVH55JLr0Umcl9T6xi85t4VpW07h8RwNJr4Cwc4EXawS9KFiGO70ubpNBcmAmDdOSNZR8T5Yg0IoOQf7DSfW9tAJRWcpXPaapWM1nVt8ObpukY8ie29GHNzAiBX7QVqI73/LIWMzn2FQylGMcieCW1TfBMhPYSoE5zFitLVZ5BhQnkadt6nGKt5/jMafI1Oq8Ak6zW4xrEaDVIGj4fD4SPiCknpQLy4ATyaVgFptVH2JFXb+wze3DDSTioV/iaD1+eZqWT92xD2Vu2X7af3+IJ6G7/UToVigpJnTzwTO42eWDnELsTtH/wUqH4=)

That's all you need to know about slots for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on [Slots](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots).

### Dynamic Components

Sometimes, it's useful to dynamically switch between components, like in a tabbed interface:

[Open example in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNVMGOmzAQ/ZURe2BXCiHbrXpwk1X31mMPvS1V5RiTWAEb2SZNhPLvHdvggLZRE6TIM/P8/N5gpk/e2nZ57HhCkrVhWrQWDLdd+1pI0bRKW/iuGg6VVg2ky9wFDp7G8g9lrIl1H80Bb5rtxfFKMcRzUA+aV3AZQKEEhWRKGgus05pL+5NuYeNwj6mTkT4VckRYujVY63GT17twC6/Fr4YjC3kp5DoPNtEgBpY3bU0txwhgXYojsJoasymSkjeqSHweK9vOWoUbXIC/Y1YpjaDH3wt39hMI6TUUSYSQAz8jArPT5Mj+nmIhC6zpAu1TZlEhmXndbBwpXH5NGL6xWrADMsyaMj1lkAzQ92E7mvYe8nCcM24xZApbL5ECiHCSnP73KyseGnvh6V/XedwS2pVjv3C1ziddxNDYc+2WS9fC8E4qJW1W0UbUZwKGSpMZrkX11dW2SpdcE3huT2BULUp44JxPSpmmpegMgU/tyadbWpZC7jCxwj0v+OfTDdU7ITOrWiTjzTS3Vei8IfB5xHZ4PmqoObMEJHryWXXkuqrVn+xEgHZWYRKbh06uLyv4iQq+oIDnkXSQiwKymlc26n75WNdit78FmLWCMeZL+GKMwlKrhLRcBzhlh51WnSwJPFQr9/zLdIZ007w/O6bR4MQe2bseBJMzer5yzwf8MtzbOzYMkNsOY0+HfoZv1d+lZJGMg8fNqdsfbbio4b77uRVv7I0Li8xxZN1PHWbeHdyTWXc/+zgw/8t/+QsROe9h)

The above is made possible by Vue's `<component>` element with the special `is` attribute:

```vue-html
<!-- Component changes when currentTab changes -->
<component :is="tabs[currentTab]"></component>
```

In the example above, the value passed to `:is` can contain either:

- the name string of a registered component, OR
- the actual imported component object

You can also use the `is` attribute to create regular HTML elements.

When switching between multiple components with `<component :is="...">`, a component will be unmounted when it is switched away from. We can force the inactive components to stay "alive" with the built-in [`` component](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/keep-alive).

### in-DOM Template Parsing Caveats

If you are writing your Vue templates directly in the DOM, Vue will have to retrieve the template string from the DOM. This leads to some caveats due to browsers' native HTML parsing behavior.

> **It Should Be Noted That The Limitations Discussed Below Only Apply If You Are Writing Your Templates Directly In The Dom. They Do Not Apply If You Are Using String Templates From The Following Sources::**

- Single-File Components
- Inlined template strings (e.g. `template: '...'`)
- `<script type="text/x-template">`
  :::

#### Case Insensitivity

HTML tags and attribute names are case-insensitive, so browsers will interpret any uppercase characters as lowercase. That means when you’re using in-DOM templates, PascalCase component names and camelCased prop names or `v-on` event names all need to use their kebab-cased (hyphen-delimited) equivalents:

```js
// camelCase in JavaScript
const BlogPost = {
  props: ['postTitle'],
  emits: ['updatePost'],
  template: `
    <h3>{{ postTitle }}</h3>
  `
}
```

```vue-html
<!-- kebab-case in HTML -->
<blog-post post-title="hello!" @update-post="onUpdatePost"></blog-post>
```

#### Self Closing Tags

We have been using self-closing tags for components in previous code samples:

```vue-html
<MyComponent />
```

This is because Vue's template parser respects `/>` as an indication to end any tag, regardless of its type.

In in-DOM templates, however, we must always include explicit closing tags:

```vue-html
<my-component></my-component>
```

This is because the HTML spec only allows [a few specific elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements) to omit closing tags, the most common being `<input>` and ``. For all other elements, if you omit the closing tag, the native HTML parser will think you never terminated the opening tag. For example, the following snippet:

```vue-html
<my-component /> <!-- we intend to close the tag here... -->
<span>hello</span>
```

will be parsed as:

```vue-html
<my-component>
  <span>hello</span>
</my-component> <!-- but the browser will close it here. -->
```

#### Element Placement Restrictions

Some HTML elements, such as `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>` and `<select>` have restrictions on what elements can appear inside them, and some elements such as `<li>`, `<tr>`, and `<option>` can only appear inside certain other elements.

This will lead to issues when using components with elements that have such restrictions. For example:

```vue-html
<table>
  <blog-post-row></blog-post-row>
</table>
```

The custom component `<blog-post-row>` will be hoisted out as invalid content, causing errors in the eventual rendered output. We can use the special [`is` attribute](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-special-attributes#is) as a workaround:

```vue-html
<table>
  <tr is="vue:blog-post-row"></tr>
</table>
```

## Component Registration

> **Source:** [Component Registration](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/registration.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

> This page assumes you've already read the [Components Basics](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics). Read that first if you are new to components.

A Vue component needs to be "registered" so that Vue knows where to locate its implementation when it is encountered in a template. There are two ways to register components: global and local.

### Global Registration

We can make components available globally in the current [Vue application](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application) using the `.component()` method:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp({})

app.component(
  // the registered name
  'MyComponent',
  // the implementation
  {
    /* ... */
  }
)
```

If using SFCs, you will be registering the imported `.vue` files:

```js
import MyComponent from './App.vue'

app.component('MyComponent', MyComponent)
```

The `.component()` method can be chained:

```js
app
  .component('ComponentA', ComponentA)
  .component('ComponentB', ComponentB)
  .component('ComponentC', ComponentC)
```

Globally registered components can be used in the template of any component within this application:

```vue-html
<!-- this will work in any component inside the app -->
<ComponentA/>
<ComponentB/>
<ComponentC/>
```

This even applies to all subcomponents, meaning all three of these components will also be available _inside each other_.

### Local Registration

While convenient, global registration has a few drawbacks:

1. Global registration prevents build systems from removing unused components (a.k.a "tree-shaking"). If you globally register a component but end up not using it anywhere in your app, it will still be included in the final bundle.

2. Global registration makes dependency relationships less explicit in large applications. It makes it difficult to locate a child component's implementation from a parent component using it. This can affect long-term maintainability similar to using too many global variables.

Local registration scopes the availability of the registered components to the current component only. It makes the dependency relationship more explicit, and is more tree-shaking friendly.

When using SFC with `<script setup>`, imported components can be locally used without registration:

```vue
<script setup>
import ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <ComponentA />
</template>
```

In non-`<script setup>`, you will need to use the `components` option:

```js
import ComponentA from './ComponentA.js'

export default {
  components: {
    ComponentA
  },
  setup() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

For each property in the `components` object, the key will be the registered name of the component, while the value will contain the implementation of the component. The above example is using the ES2015 property shorthand and is equivalent to:

```js
export default {
  components: {
    ComponentA: ComponentA
  }
  // ...
}
```

Note that **locally registered components are _not_ also available in descendant components**. In this case, `ComponentA` will be made available to the current component only, not any of its child or descendant components.

### Component Name Casing

Throughout the guide, we are using PascalCase names when registering components. This is because:

1. PascalCase names are valid JavaScript identifiers. This makes it easier to import and register components in JavaScript. It also helps IDEs with auto-completion.

2. `` makes it more obvious that this is a Vue component instead of a native HTML element in templates. It also differentiates Vue components from custom elements (web components).

This is the recommended style when working with SFC or string templates. However, as discussed in [in-DOM Template Parsing Caveats](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats), PascalCase tags are not usable in in-DOM templates.

Luckily, Vue supports resolving kebab-case tags to components registered using PascalCase. This means a component registered as `MyComponent` can be referenced inside a Vue template (or inside an HTML element rendered by Vue) via both `` and `<my-component>`. This allows us to use the same JavaScript component registration code regardless of template source.

## Props

> **Source:** [Props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

> This page assumes you've already read the [Components Basics](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics). Read that first if you are new to components.

### Props Declaration

Vue components require explicit props declaration so that Vue knows what external props passed to the component should be treated as fallthrough attributes (which will be discussed in [its dedicated section](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs)).

In SFCs using `<script setup>`, props can be declared using the `defineProps()` macro:

```vue
<script setup>
const props = defineProps(['foo'])

console.log(props.foo)
</script>
```

In non-`<script setup>` components, props are declared using the [`props`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state#props) option:

```js
export default {
  props: ['foo'],
  setup(props) {
    // setup() receives props as the first argument.
    console.log(props.foo)
  }
}
```

Notice the argument passed to `defineProps()` is the same as the value provided to the `props` options: the same props options API is shared between the two declaration styles.

In addition to declaring props using an array of strings, we can also use the object syntax:

```js
// in <script setup>
defineProps({
  title: String,
  likes: Number
})
```

```js
// in non-<script setup>
export default {
  props: {
    title: String,
    likes: Number
  }
}
```

For each property in the object declaration syntax, the key is the name of the prop, while the value should be the constructor function of the expected type.

This not only documents your component, but will also warn other developers using your component in the browser console if they pass the wrong type. We will discuss more details about [prop validation](#prop-validation) further down this page.

If you are using TypeScript with `<script setup>`, it's also possible to declare props using pure type annotations:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{
  title?: string
  likes?: number
}>()
</script>
```

More details: [Typing Component Props](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-component-props) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

### Reactive Props Destructure <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> \*\*

Vue's reactivity system tracks state usage based on property access. E.g. when you access `props.foo` in a computed getter or a watcher, the `foo` prop gets tracked as a dependency.

So, given the following code:

```js
const { foo } = defineProps(['foo'])

watchEffect(() => {
  // runs only once before 3.5
  // re-runs when the "foo" prop changes in 3.5+
  console.log(foo)
})
```

In version 3.4 and below, `foo` is an actual constant and will never change. In version 3.5 and above, Vue's compiler automatically prepends `props.` when code in the same `<script setup>` block accesses variables destructured from `defineProps`. Therefore the code above becomes equivalent to the following:

```js
const props = defineProps(['foo'])

watchEffect(() => {
  // `foo` transformed to `props.foo` by the compiler
  console.log(props.foo)
})
```

In addition, you can use JavaScript's native default value syntax to declare default values for the props. This is particularly useful when using the type-based props declaration:

```ts
const { foo = 'hello' } = defineProps<{ foo?: string }>()
```

If you prefer to have more visual distinction between destructured props and normal variables in your IDE, Vue's VSCode extension provides a setting to enable inlay-hints for destructured props.

#### Passing Destructured Props into Functions

When we pass a destructured prop into a function, e.g.:

```js
const { foo } = defineProps(['foo'])

watch(foo, /* ... */)
```

This will not work as expected because it is equivalent to `watch(props.foo, ...)` - we are passing a value instead of a reactive data source to `watch`. In fact, Vue's compiler will catch such cases and throw a warning.

Similar to how we can watch a normal prop with `watch(() => props.foo, ...)`, we can watch a destructured prop also by wrapping it in a getter:

```js
watch(() => foo, /* ... */)
```

In addition, this is the recommended approach when we need to pass a destructured prop into an external function while retaining reactivity:

```js
useComposable(() => foo)
```

The external function can call the getter (or normalize it with [toValue](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-utilities.html#tovalue)) when it needs to track changes of the provided prop, e.g. in a computed or watcher getter.

### Prop Passing Details

#### Prop Name Casing

We declare long prop names using camelCase because this avoids having to use quotes when using them as property keys, and allows us to reference them directly in template expressions because they are valid JavaScript identifiers:

```js
defineProps({
  greetingMessage: String
})
```

```vue-html
<span>{{ greetingMessage }}</span>
```

Technically, you can also use camelCase when passing props to a child component (except in [in-DOM templates](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats)). However, the convention is using kebab-case in all cases to align with HTML attributes:

```vue-html
<MyComponent greeting-message="hello" />
```

We use [PascalCase for component tags](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/registration#component-name-casing) when possible because it improves template readability by differentiating Vue components from native elements. However, there isn't as much practical benefit in using camelCase when passing props, so we choose to follow each language's conventions.

#### Static vs. Dynamic Props

So far, you've seen props passed as static values, like in:

```vue-html
<BlogPost title="My journey with Vue" />
```

You've also seen props assigned dynamically with `v-bind` or its `:` shortcut, such as in:

```vue-html
<!-- Dynamically assign the value of a variable -->
<BlogPost :title="post.title" />

<!-- Dynamically assign the value of a complex expression -->
<BlogPost :title="post.title + ' by ' + post.author.name" />
```

#### Passing Different Value Types

In the two examples above, we happen to pass string values, but _any_ type of value can be passed to a prop.

##### Number

```vue-html
<!-- Even though `42` is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->
<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.       -->
<BlogPost :likes="42" />

<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->
<BlogPost :likes="post.likes" />
```

##### Boolean

```vue-html
<!-- Including the prop with no value will imply `true`. -->
<BlogPost is-published />

<!-- Even though `false` is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->
<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.          -->
<BlogPost :is-published="false" />

<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->
<BlogPost :is-published="post.isPublished" />
```

##### Array

```vue-html
<!-- Even though the array is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->
<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.            -->
<BlogPost :comment-ids="[234, 266, 273]" />

<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->
<BlogPost :comment-ids="post.commentIds" />
```

##### Object

```vue-html
<!-- Even though the object is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->
<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.             -->
<BlogPost
  :author="{
    name: 'Veronica',
    company: 'Veridian Dynamics'
  }"
 />

<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->
<BlogPost :author="post.author" />
```

#### Binding Multiple Properties Using an Object

If you want to pass all the properties of an object as props, you can use [`v-bind` without an argument](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax#dynamically-binding-multiple-attributes) (`v-bind` instead of `:prop-name`). For example, given a `post` object:

```js
const post = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'My Journey with Vue'
}
```

The following template:

```vue-html
<BlogPost v-bind="post" />
```

Will be equivalent to:

```vue-html
<BlogPost :id="post.id" :title="post.title" />
```

#### Merge Behavior When Combining Bindings

When `v-bind` is used alongside explicit bindings on the same component, Vue internally calls `mergeProps()` to combine them. The merging strategy depends on the key type:

- **Regular props** — the last value wins:

```vue-html
<!-- title === 'bar' -->
<BlogPost title="foo" v-bind="{ title: 'bar' }" />
```

- **Event listeners** — when passing listeners in a `v-bind` object, [use the `onEventName` key convention](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/render-function#v-on). All handlers for the same event will be called (see [`v-on` Listener Inheritance](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs#v-on-listener-inheritance)):

```vue-html
<!-- logs 1 and 2 -->
<BlogPost @click="console.log(1)" v-bind="{ onClick: () => console.log(2) }" />
```

- **`class` and `style`** follow a similar merge strategy (see [`class` and `style` Merging](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs#class-and-style-merging)).

> **The Full Merging Rules Are Described In The [`Mergeprops()`](https://vuejs.org/Api/Render-Function#Mergeprops) Api Reference.:**

### One-Way Data Flow

All props form a **one-way-down binding** between the child property and the parent one: when the parent property updates, it will flow down to the child, but not the other way around. This prevents child components from accidentally mutating the parent's state, which can make your app's data flow harder to understand.

In addition, every time the parent component is updated, all props in the child component will be refreshed with the latest value. This means you should **not** attempt to mutate a prop inside a child component. If you do, Vue will warn you in the console:

```js
const props = defineProps(['foo'])

// ❌ warning, props are readonly!
props.foo = 'bar'
```

There are usually two cases where it's tempting to mutate a prop:

1. **The prop is used to pass in an initial value; the child component wants to use it as a local data property afterwards.** In this case, it's best to define a local data property that uses the prop as its initial value:

   ```js
   const props = defineProps(['initialCounter'])

   // counter only uses props.initialCounter as the initial value;
   // it is disconnected from future prop updates.
   const counter = ref(props.initialCounter)
   ```

2. **The prop is passed in as a raw value that needs to be transformed.** In this case, it's best to define a computed property using the prop's value:

   ```js
   const props = defineProps(['size'])

   // computed property that auto-updates when the prop changes
   const normalizedSize = computed(() => props.size.trim().toLowerCase())
   ```

#### Mutating Object / Array Props

When objects and arrays are passed as props, while the child component cannot mutate the prop binding, it **will** be able to mutate the object or array's nested properties. This is because in JavaScript objects and arrays are passed by reference, and it is unreasonably expensive for Vue to prevent such mutations.

The main drawback of such mutations is that it allows the child component to affect parent state in a way that isn't obvious to the parent component, potentially making it more difficult to reason about the data flow in the future. As a best practice, you should avoid such mutations unless the parent and child are tightly coupled by design. In most cases, the child should [emit an event](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events) to let the parent perform the mutation.

### Prop Validation

Components can specify requirements for their props, such as the types you've already seen. If a requirement is not met, Vue will warn you in the browser's JavaScript console. This is especially useful when developing a component that is intended to be used by others.

To specify prop validations, you can provide an object with validation requirements to the <span class="composition-api">`defineProps()` macro</span><span class="options-api">`props` option</span>, instead of an array of strings. For example:

```js
defineProps({
  // Basic type check
  //  (`null` and `undefined` values will allow any type)
  propA: Number,
  // Multiple possible types
  propB: [String, Number],
  // Required string
  propC: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  // Required but nullable string
  propD: {
    type: [String, null],
    required: true
  },
  // Number with a default value
  propE: {
    type: Number,
    default: 100
  },
  // Object with a default value
  propF: {
    type: Object,
    // Object or array defaults must be returned from
    // a factory function. The function receives the raw
    // props received by the component as the argument.
    default(rawProps) {
      return { message: 'hello' }
    }
  },
  // Custom validator function
  // full props passed as 2nd argument in 3.4+
  propG: {
    validator(value, props) {
      // The value must match one of these strings
      return ['success', 'warning', 'danger'].includes(value)
    }
  },
  // Function with a default value
  propH: {
    type: Function,
    // Unlike object or array default, this is not a factory
    // function - this is a function to serve as a default value
    default() {
      return 'Default function'
    }
  }
})
```

> **Code Inside The `Defineprops()` Argument **Cannot Access Other Variables Declared In `<Script Setup>`**, Because The Entire Expression Is Moved To An Outer Function Scope When Compiled.:**
> **Details::**

- All props are optional by default, unless `required: true` is specified.

- An absent optional prop other than `Boolean` will have `undefined` value.

- The `Boolean` absent props will be cast to `false`. You can change this by setting a `default` for it — i.e.: `default: undefined` to behave as a non-Boolean prop.

- If a `default` value is specified, it will be used if the resolved prop value is `undefined` - this includes both when the prop is absent, or an explicit `undefined` value is passed.

When prop validation fails, Vue will produce a console warning (if using the development build).

If using [Type-based props declarations](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />, Vue will try its best to compile the type annotations into equivalent runtime prop declarations. For example, `defineProps<{ msg: string }>` will be compiled into `{ msg: { type: String, required: true }}`.

#### Runtime Type Checks

The `type` can be one of the following native constructors:

- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Array`
- `Object`
- `Date`
- `Function`
- `Symbol`
- `Error`

In addition, `type` can also be a custom class or constructor function and the assertion will be made with an `instanceof` check. For example, given the following class:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}
```

You could use it as a prop's type:

```js
defineProps({
  author: Person
})
```

Vue will use `instanceof Person` to validate whether the value of the `author` prop is indeed an instance of the `Person` class.

#### Nullable Type

If the type is required but nullable, you can use the array syntax that includes `null`:

```js
defineProps({
  id: {
    type: [String, null],
    required: true
  }
})
```

Note that if `type` is just `null` without using the array syntax, it will allow any type.

### Boolean Casting

Props with `Boolean` type have special casting rules to mimic the behavior of native boolean attributes. Given a `` with the following declaration:

```js
defineProps({
  disabled: Boolean
})
```

The component can be used like this:

```vue-html
<!-- equivalent of passing :disabled="true" -->
<MyComponent disabled />

<!-- equivalent of passing :disabled="false" -->
<MyComponent />
```

When a prop is declared to allow multiple types, the casting rules for `Boolean` will also be applied. However, there is an edge when both `String` and `Boolean` are allowed - the Boolean casting rule only applies if Boolean appears before String:

```js
// disabled will be casted to true
defineProps({
  disabled: [Boolean, Number]
})

// disabled will be casted to true
defineProps({
  disabled: [Boolean, String]
})

// disabled will be casted to true
defineProps({
  disabled: [Number, Boolean]
})

// disabled will be parsed as an empty string (disabled="")
defineProps({
  disabled: [String, Boolean]
})
```

## Component Events

> **Source:** [Component Events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

<script setup>
import { onMounted } from 'vue'

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  const hash = window.location.hash

  // The docs for v-model used to be part of this page. Attempt to redirect outdated links.

    onMounted(() => {
      window.location = './v-model.html' + hash
    })
  }
}
</script>

### Component Events

> This page assumes you've already read the [Components Basics](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics). Read that first if you are new to components.

#### Emitting and Listening to Events

A component can emit custom events directly in template expressions (e.g. in a `v-on` handler) using the built-in `$emit` method:

```vue-html
<!-- MyComponent -->
<button @click="$emit('someEvent')">Click Me</button>
```

The parent can then listen to it using `v-on`:

```vue-html
<MyComponent @some-event="callback" />
```

The `.once` modifier is also supported on component event listeners:

```vue-html
<MyComponent @some-event.once="callback" />
```

Like components and props, event names provide an automatic case transformation. Notice we emitted a camelCase event, but can listen for it using a kebab-cased listener in the parent. As with [props casing](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props#prop-name-casing), we recommend using kebab-cased event listeners in templates.

> **Unlike Native Dom Events, Component Emitted Events Do **Not** Bubble. You Can Only Listen To The Events Emitted By A Direct Child Component. If There Is A Need To Communicate Between Sibling Or Deeply Nested Components, Use An External Event Bus Or A [Global State Management Solution](https://vuejs.org/Guide/Scaling-Up/State-Management).:**

#### Event Arguments

It's sometimes useful to emit a specific value with an event. For example, we may want the `` component to be in charge of how much to enlarge the text by. In those cases, we can pass extra arguments to `$emit` to provide this value:

```vue-html
<button @click="$emit('increaseBy', 1)">
  Increase by 1
</button>
```

Then, when we listen to the event in the parent, we can use an inline arrow function as the listener, which allows us to access the event argument:

```vue-html
<MyButton @increase-by="(n) => count += n" />
```

Or, if the event handler is a method:

```vue-html
<MyButton @increase-by="increaseCount" />
```

Then the value will be passed as the first parameter of that method:

```js
function increaseCount(n) {
  count.value += n
}
```

> **All Extra Arguments Passed To `$Emit()` After The Event Name Will Be Forwarded To The Listener. For Example, With `$Emit('Foo', 1, 2, 3)` The Listener Function Will Receive Three Arguments.:**

#### Declaring Emitted Events

A component can explicitly declare the events it will emit using the <span class="composition-api">[`defineEmits()`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits) macro</span><span class="options-api">[`emits`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state#emits) option</span>:

```vue
<script setup>
defineEmits(['inFocus', 'submit'])
</script>
```

The `$emit` method that we used in the `<template>` isn't accessible within the `<script setup>` section of a component, but `defineEmits()` returns an equivalent function that we can use instead:

```vue
<script setup>
const emit = defineEmits(['inFocus', 'submit'])

function buttonClick() {
  emit('submit')
}
</script>
```

The `defineEmits()` macro **cannot** be used inside a function, it must be placed directly within `<script setup>`, as in the example above.

If you're using an explicit `setup` function instead of `<script setup>`, events should be declared using the [`emits`](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state#emits) option, and the `emit` function is exposed on the `setup()` context:

```js
export default {
  emits: ['inFocus', 'submit'],
  setup(props, ctx) {
    ctx.emit('submit')
  }
}
```

As with other properties of the `setup()` context, `emit` can safely be destructured:

```js
export default {
  emits: ['inFocus', 'submit'],
  setup(props, { emit }) {
    emit('submit')
  }
}
```

The `emits` option and `defineEmits()` macro also support an object syntax. If using TypeScript you can type arguments, which allows us to perform runtime validation of the payload of the emitted events:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const emit = defineEmits({
  submit(payload: { email: string, password: string }) {
    // return `true` or `false` to indicate
    // validation pass / fail
  }
})
</script>
```

If you are using TypeScript with `<script setup>`, it's also possible to declare emitted events using pure type annotations:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const emit = defineEmits<{
  (e: 'change', id: number): void
  (e: 'update', value: string): void
}>()
</script>
```

More details: [Typing Component Emits](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-component-emits) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

Although optional, it is recommended to define all emitted events in order to better document how a component should work. It also allows Vue to exclude known listeners from [fallthrough attributes](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs#v-on-listener-inheritance), avoiding edge cases caused by DOM events manually dispatched by 3rd party code.

> **If A Native Event (E.G., `Click`) Is Defined In The `Emits` Option, The Listener Will Now Only Listen To Component-Emitted `Click` Events And No Longer Respond To Native `Click` Events.:**

#### Events Validation

Similar to prop type validation, an emitted event can be validated if it is defined with the object syntax instead of the array syntax.

To add validation, the event is assigned a function that receives the arguments passed to the <span class="options-api">`this.$emit`</span><span class="composition-api">`emit`</span> call and returns a boolean to indicate whether the event is valid or not.

```vue
<script setup>
const emit = defineEmits({
  // No validation
  click: null,

  // Validate submit event
  submit: ({ email, password }) => {
    if (email && password) {
      return true
    } else {
      console.warn('Invalid submit event payload!')
      return false
    }
  }
})

function submitForm(email, password) {
  emit('submit', { email, password })
}
</script>
```

## Component v-model

> **Source:** [Component v-model](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html) · [Vue docs](https://github.com/vuejs/docs), CC BY 4.0 (text)

  Watch an interactive video lesson on Scrimba

### Basic Usage

`v-model` can be used on a component to implement a two-way binding.

Starting in Vue 3.4, the recommended approach to achieve this is using the [`defineModel()`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#definemodel) macro:

```vue
<script setup>
const model = defineModel()

function update() {
  model.value++
}
</script>

<template>
  Parent bound v-model is: {{ model }}
  <button @click="update">Increment</button>
</template>
```

The parent can then bind a value with `v-model`:

```vue-html
<Child v-model="countModel" />
```

The value returned by `defineModel()` is a ref. It can be accessed and mutated like any other ref, except that it acts as a two-way binding between a parent value and a local one:

- Its `.value` is synced with the value bound by the parent `v-model`;
- When it is mutated by the child, it causes the parent bound value to be updated as well.

This means you can also bind this ref to a native input element with `v-model`, making it straightforward to wrap native input elements while providing the same `v-model` usage:

```vue
<script setup>
const model = defineModel()
</script>

<template>
  <input v-model="model" />
</template>
```

[Try it in the playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFUtFKwzAU/ZWYl06YLbK30Q10DFSYigq+5KW0t11mmoQknZPSf/cm3eqEsT0l555zuefmpKV3WsfbBuiUpjY3XDtiwTV6ziSvtTKOLNZcFKQ0qiZRnATkG6JB0BIDJen2kp5iMlfSOlLbisw8P4oeQAhFPpURxVV0zWSa9PNwEgIHtRaZA0SEpOvbeduG5q5LE0Sh2jvZ3tSqADFjFHlGSYJkmhz10zF1FseXvIo3VklcrfX9jOaq1lyAedGOoz1GpyQwnsvQ3fdTqDnTwPhQz9eQf52ob+zO1xh9NWDBbIHRgXOZqcD19PL9GXZ4H0h03whUnyHfwCrReI+97L6RBdo+0gW3j+H9uaw+7HLnQNrDUt6oV3ZBzyhmsjiz+p/dSTwJfUx2+IpD1ic+xz5enwQGXEDJJaw8Gl2I1upMzlc/hEvdOBR6SNKAjqP1J6P/o6XdL11L5h4=)

#### Under the Hood

`defineModel` is a convenience macro. The compiler expands it to the following:

- A prop named `modelValue`, which the local ref's value is synced with;
- An event named `update:modelValue`, which is emitted when the local ref's value is mutated.

This is how you would implement the same child component shown above prior to 3.4:

```vue
<script setup>
const props = defineProps(['modelValue'])
const emit = defineEmits(['update:modelValue'])
</script>

<template>
  <input
    :value="props.modelValue"
    @input="emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)"
  />
</template>
```

Then, `v-model="foo"` in the parent component will be compiled to:

```vue-html
<Child
  :modelValue="foo"
  @update:modelValue="$event => (foo = $event)"
/>
```

As you can see, it is quite a bit more verbose. However, it is helpful to understand what is happening under the hood.

Because `defineModel` declares a prop, you can therefore declare the underlying prop's options by passing it to `defineModel`:

```js
// making the v-model required
const model = defineModel({ required: true })

// providing a default value
const model = defineModel({ default: 0 })
```

> **If You Have A `Default` Value For `Definemodel` Prop And You Don'T Provide Any Value For This Prop From The Parent Component, It Can Cause A De-Synchronization Between Parent And Child Components. In The Example Below, The Parent'S `Myref` Is Undefined, But The Child'S `Model` Is 1::**

```vue
<script setup>
const model = defineModel({ default: 1 })
</script>
```

```vue
<script setup>
const myRef = ref()
</script>

<template>
  <Child v-model="myRef"></Child>
</template>
```

Also, when using `withDefaults` with `defineProps`, default values for mutable reference types (like arrays or objects) should be wrapped in functions in `defineModel` to avoid accidental modification and external side effects.

### `v-model` Arguments

`v-model` on a component can also accept an argument:

```vue-html
<MyComponent v-model:title="bookTitle" />
```

In the child component, we can support the corresponding argument by passing a string to `defineModel()` as its first argument:

```vue
<script setup>
const title = defineModel('title')
</script>

<template>
  <input type="text" v-model="title" />
</template>
```

### Multiple `v-model` Bindings

By leveraging the ability to target a particular prop and event as we learned before with [`v-model` arguments](#v-model-arguments), we can now create multiple `v-model` bindings on a single component instance.

Each `v-model` will sync to a different prop, without the need for extra options in the component:

```vue-html
<UserName
  v-model:first-name="first"
  v-model:last-name="last"
/>
```

```vue
<script setup>
const firstName = defineModel('firstName')
const lastName = defineModel('lastName')
</script>

<template>
  <input type="text" v-model="firstName" />
  <input type="text" v-model="lastName" />
</template>
```

### Handling `v-model` Modifiers

When we were learning about form input bindings, we saw that `v-model` has [built-in modifiers](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/forms#modifiers) - `.trim`, `.number` and `.lazy`. In some cases, you might also want the `v-model` on your custom input component to support custom modifiers.

Let's create an example custom modifier, `capitalize`, that capitalizes the first letter of the string provided by the `v-model` binding:

```vue-html
<MyComponent v-model.capitalize="myText" />
```

Modifiers added to a component `v-model` can be accessed in the child component by destructuring the `defineModel()` return value like this:

```vue{4}
<script setup>
const [model, modifiers] = defineModel()

console.log(modifiers) // { capitalize: true }
</script>

<template>
  <input type="text" v-model="model" />
</template>
```

To conditionally adjust how the value should be read / written based on modifiers, we can pass `get` and `set` options to `defineModel()`. These two options receive the value on get / set of the model ref and should return a transformed value. This is how we can use the `set` option to implement the `capitalize` modifier:

```vue{4-6}
<script setup>
const [model, modifiers] = defineModel({
  set(value) {
    if (modifiers.capitalize) {
      return value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1)
    }
    return value
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <input type="text" v-model="model" />
</template>
```

## Slots

### Slot Content and Outlet

We have learned that components can accept props, which can be JavaScript values of any type. But how about template content? In some cases, we may want to pass a template fragment to a child component, and let the child component render the fragment within its own template.

For example, we may have a `` component that supports usage like this:

```vue-html{2}
<FancyButton>
  Click me! <!-- slot content -->
</FancyButton>
```

The template of `` looks like this:

```vue-html{2}
<button class="fancy-btn">
  <slot></slot> <!-- slot outlet -->
</button>
```

The `<slot>` element is a **slot outlet** that indicates where the parent-provided **slot content** should be rendered.

<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/LjKTYVL97Ck6TEmBbstavX/slot -->

And the final rendered DOM:

```html
<button class="fancy-btn">Click me!</button>
```

With slots, the `` is responsible for rendering the outer `<button>` (and its fancy styling), while the inner content is provided by the parent component.

Another way to understand slots is by comparing them to JavaScript functions:

```js
// parent component passing slot content
FancyButton('Click me!')

// FancyButton renders slot content in its own template
function FancyButton(slotContent) {
  return `<button class="fancy-btn">
      ${slotContent}
    </button>`
}
```

Slot content is not just limited to text. It can be any valid template content. For example, we can pass in multiple elements, or even other components:

```vue-html
<FancyButton>
  <span style="color:red">Click me!</span>
  <AwesomeIcon name="plus" />
</FancyButton>
```

By using slots, our `` is more flexible and reusable. We can now use it in different places with different inner content, but all with the same fancy styling.

Vue components' slot mechanism is inspired by the [native Web Component `<slot>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot), but with additional capabilities that we will see later.

### Render Scope

Slot content has access to the data scope of the parent component, because it is defined in the parent. For example:

```vue-html
<span>{{ message }}</span>
<FancyButton>{{ message }}</FancyButton>
```

Here both <span v-pre>`{{ message }}`</span> interpolations will render the same content.

Slot content does **not** have access to the child component's data. Expressions in Vue templates can only access the scope it is defined in, consistent with JavaScript's lexical scoping. In other words:

> Expressions in the parent template only have access to the parent scope; expressions in the child template only have access to the child scope.

> **Note:**
Because slot content is part of the parent's render scope, a `<style scoped>` block declared in the child component **will not** apply to it. If you need to style slotted content, do so from the parent component, or use the `:deep()` modifier in the child's scoped stylesheet (see [Scoped CSS](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features#scoped-css) for details).

### Fallback Content

There are cases when it's useful to specify fallback (i.e. default) content for a slot, to be rendered only when no content is provided. For example, in a `` component:

```vue-html
<button type="submit">
  <slot></slot>
</button>
```

We might want the text "Submit" to be rendered inside the `<button>` if the parent didn't provide any slot content. To make "Submit" the fallback content, we can place it in between the `<slot>` tags:

```vue-html{3}
<button type="submit">
  <slot>
    Submit <!-- fallback content -->
  </slot>
</button>
```

Now when we use `` in a parent component, providing no content for the slot:

```vue-html
<SubmitButton />
```

This will render the fallback content, "Submit":

```html
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

But if we provide content:

```vue-html
<SubmitButton>Save</SubmitButton>
```

Then the provided content will be rendered instead:

```html
<button type="submit">Save</button>
```

### Named Slots

There are times when it's useful to have multiple slot outlets in a single component. For example, in a `` component with the following template:

```vue-html

  <header>
    <!-- We want header content here -->
  </header>
  <main>
    <!-- We want main content here -->
  </main>
  <footer>
    <!-- We want footer content here -->
  </footer>

```

For these cases, the `<slot>` element has a special attribute, `name`, which can be used to assign a unique ID to different slots so you can determine where content should be rendered:

```vue-html

  <header>
    <slot name="header"></slot>
  </header>
  <main>
    <slot></slot>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <slot name="footer"></slot>
  </footer>

```

A `<slot>` outlet without `name` implicitly has the name "default".

In a parent component using ``, we need a way to pass multiple slot content fragments, each targeting a different slot outlet. This is where **named slots** come in.

To pass a named slot, we need to use a `<template>` element with the `v-slot` directive, and then pass the name of the slot as an argument to `v-slot`:

```vue-html
<BaseLayout>
  <template v-slot:header>
    <!-- content for the header slot -->
  </template>
</BaseLayout>
```

`v-slot` has a dedicated shorthand `#`, so `<template v-slot:header>` can be shortened to just `<template #header>`. Think of it as "render this template fragment in the child component's 'header' slot".

<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/2BhP8gVZevttBu9oUmUUyz/named-slot -->

Here's the code passing content for all three slots to `` using the shorthand syntax:

```vue-html
<BaseLayout>
  <template #header>
    <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>
  </template>

  <template #default>
    <p>A paragraph for the main content.</p>
    <p>And another one.</p>
  </template>

  <template #footer>
    <p>Here's some contact info</p>
  </template>
</BaseLayout>
```

When a component accepts both a default slot and named slots, all top-level non-`<template>` nodes are implicitly treated as content for the default slot. So the above can also be written as:

```vue-html
<BaseLayout>
  <template #header>
    <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>
  </template>

  <!-- implicit default slot -->
  <p>A paragraph for the main content.</p>
  <p>And another one.</p>

  <template #footer>
    <p>Here's some contact info</p>
  </template>
</BaseLayout>
```

Now everything inside the `<template>` elements will be passed to the corresponding slots. The final rendered HTML will be:

```html

  <header>
    <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>A paragraph for the main content.</p>
    <p>And another one.</p>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>Here's some contact info</p>
  </footer>

```

Again, it may help you understand named slots better using the JavaScript function analogy:

```js
// passing multiple slot fragments with different names
BaseLayout({
  header: `...`,
  default: `...`,
  footer: `...`
})

// <BaseLayout> renders them in different places
function BaseLayout(slots) {
  return `
      <header>${slots.header}</header>
      <main>${slots.default}</main>
      <footer>${slots.footer}</footer>
    `
}
```

### Conditional Slots

Sometimes you want to render something based on whether or not content has been passed to a slot.

You can use the [$slots](https://vuejs.org/api/component-instance.html#slots) property in combination with a [v-if](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html#v-if) to achieve this.

In the example below we define a Card component with three conditional slots: `header`, `footer` and the `default` one.
When content for the header / footer / default is present, we want to wrap it to provide additional styling:

```vue-html
<template>

      <slot name="header" />

      <slot />

      <slot name="footer" />

</template>
```

### Dynamic Slot Names

[Dynamic directive arguments](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.md#dynamic-arguments) also work on `v-slot`, allowing the definition of dynamic slot names:

```vue-html
<base-layout>
  <template v-slot:[dynamicSlotName]>
    ...
  </template>

  <!-- with shorthand -->
  <template #[dynamicSlotName]>
    ...
  </template>
</base-layout>
```

Do note the expression is subject to the [syntax constraints](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.md#dynamic-argument-syntax-constraints) of dynamic directive arguments.

### Scoped Slots

As discussed in [Render Scope](#render-scope), slot content does not have access to state in the child component.

However, there are cases where it could be useful if a slot's content can make use of data from both the parent scope and the child scope. To achieve that, we need a way for the child to pass data to a slot when rendering it.

In fact, we can do exactly that - we can pass attributes to a slot outlet just like passing props to a component. The parent template receives slot props with `v-slot`, while the child template passes props to the slot outlet when rendering:

```vue-html
<!-- Parent template (usage) -->
<ChildComponent v-slot="receivedProps">
  {{ receivedProps.text }} {{ receivedProps.count }}
</ChildComponent>
```

```vue-html
<!-- Child template (slot definition) -->
<!-- render with props! -->
<slot
  text="hello"
  :count="1"
/>
```

Receiving the slot props is a bit different when using a single default slot vs. using named slots. The example above receives props using a single default slot, by using `v-slot` directly on the `ChildComponent` tag.

The props passed to the slot by the child are available as the value of the corresponding `v-slot` directive, which can be accessed by expressions inside the slot.

You can think of a scoped slot as a function being passed into the child component. The child component then calls it, passing props as arguments:

```js
ChildComponent({
  // passing the default slot, but as a function
  default: (receivedProps) => {
    return `${receivedProps.text} ${receivedProps.count}`
  }
})

function ChildComponent(slots) {
  // call the slot function with props!
  return slots.default({ text: 'hello', count: 1 })
}
```

In fact, this is very close to how scoped slots are compiled, and how you would use scoped slots in manual [render functions](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/render-function).

Notice how `v-slot="receivedProps"` matches the slot function signature. Just like with function arguments, we can use destructuring in `v-slot`:

```vue-html
<ChildComponent v-slot="{ text, count }">
  {{ text }} {{ count }}
</ChildComponent>
```

#### Named Scoped Slots

Named scoped slots work similarly - slot props are accessible as the value of the `v-slot` directive: `v-slot:name="receivedProps"`. When using the shorthand, it looks like this:

```vue-html
<MyComponent>
  <template #header="headerProps">
    {{ headerProps }}
  </template>

  <template #default="defaultProps">
    {{ defaultProps }}
  </template>

  <template #footer="footerProps">
    {{ footerProps }}
  </template>
</MyComponent>
```

Passing props to a named slot:

```vue-html
<slot name="header" message="hello" />
```

Note the `name` of a slot won't be included in the props because it is reserved - so the resulting `headerProps` would be `{ message: 'hello' }`.

If you are mixing named slots with the default scoped slot, you need to use an explicit `<template>` tag for the default slot. Attempting to place the `v-slot` directive directly on the component will result in a compilation error. This is to avoid any ambiguity about the scope of the props of the default slot. For example:

```vue-html
<!-- <MyComponent> template -->

  <slot message="hello" />
  <slot name="footer" />

```

```vue-html
<!-- This template won't compile -->
<MyComponent v-slot="{ message }">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
  <template #footer>
    <!-- message belongs to the default slot, and is not available here -->
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  </template>
</MyComponent>
```

Using an explicit `<template>` tag for the default slot helps to make it clear that the `message` prop is not available inside the other slot:

```vue-html
<MyComponent>
  <!-- Use explicit default slot -->
  <template #default="{ message }">
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  </template>

  <template #footer>
    <p>Here's some contact info</p>
  </template>
</MyComponent>
```

#### Fancy List Example

You may be wondering what would be a good use case for scoped slots. Here's an example: imagine a `` component that renders a list of items - it may encapsulate the logic for loading remote data, using the data to display a list, or even advanced features like pagination or infinite scrolling. However, we want it to be flexible with how each item looks and leave the styling of each item to the parent component consuming it. So the desired usage may look like this:

```vue-html
<FancyList :api-url="url" :per-page="10">
  <template #item="{ body, username, likes }">

      <p>{{ body }}</p>
      <p>by {{ username }} | {{ likes }} likes</p>

  </template>
</FancyList>
```

Inside ``, we can render the same `<slot>` multiple times with different item data (notice we are using `v-bind` to pass an object as slot props):

```vue-html
<ul>
  <li v-for="item in items">
    <slot name="item" v-bind="item" />
  </li>
</ul>
```

#### Renderless Components

The `` use case we discussed above encapsulates both reusable logic (data fetching, pagination etc.) and visual output, while delegating part of the visual output to the consumer component via scoped slots.

If we push this concept a bit further, we can come up with components that only encapsulate logic and do not render anything by themselves - visual output is fully delegated to the consumer component with scoped slots. We call this type of component a **Renderless Component**.

An example renderless component could be one that encapsulates the logic of tracking the current mouse position:

```vue-html
<MouseTracker v-slot="{ x, y }">
  Mouse is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}
</MouseTracker>
```

While an interesting pattern, most of what can be achieved with Renderless Components can be achieved in a more efficient fashion with Composition API, without incurring the overhead of extra component nesting. Later, we will see how we can implement the same mouse tracking functionality as a [Composable](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables).

That said, scoped slots are still useful in cases where we need to both encapsulate logic **and** compose visual output, like in the `` example.

### Prop Drilling

Usually, when we need to pass data from the parent to a child component, we use [props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props). However, imagine the case where we have a large component tree, and a deeply nested component needs something from a distant ancestor component. With only props, we would have to pass the same prop across the entire parent chain:

<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/yNDTtReM2xVgjcGVRzChss/prop-drilling -->

Notice although the `` component may not care about these props at all, it still needs to declare and pass them along just so `` can access them. If there is a longer parent chain, more components would be affected along the way. This is called "props drilling" and definitely isn't fun to deal with.

We can solve props drilling with `provide` and `inject`. A parent component can serve as a **dependency provider** for all its descendants. Any component in the descendant tree, regardless of how deep it is, can **inject** dependencies provided by components up in its parent chain.

<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/PbTJ9oXis5KUawEOWdy2cE/provide-inject -->

### Provide

To provide data to a component's descendants, use the [`provide()`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-dependency-injection#provide) function:

```vue
<script setup>
import { provide } from 'vue'

provide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')
</script>
```

If not using `<script setup>`, make sure `provide()` is called synchronously inside `setup()`:

```js
import { provide } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    provide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')
  }
}
```

The `provide()` function accepts two arguments. The first argument is called the **injection key**, which can be a string or a `Symbol`. The injection key is used by descendant components to lookup the desired value to inject. A single component can call `provide()` multiple times with different injection keys to provide different values.

The second argument is the provided value. The value can be of any type, including reactive state such as refs:

```js
import { ref, provide } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
provide('key', count)
```

Providing reactive values allows the descendant components using the provided value to establish a reactive connection to the provider component.

### App-level Provide

In addition to providing data in a component, we can also provide at the app level:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp({})

app.provide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')
```

App-level provides are available to all components rendered in the app. This is especially useful when writing [plugins](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/plugins), as plugins typically wouldn't be able to provide values using components.

### Inject

To inject data provided by an ancestor component, use the [`inject()`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-dependency-injection#inject) function:

```vue
<script setup>
import { inject } from 'vue'

const message = inject('message')
</script>
```

If multiple parents provide data with the same key, inject will resolve to the value from the closest parent in component's parent chain.

If the provided value is a ref, it will be injected as-is and will **not** be automatically unwrapped. This allows the injector component to retain the reactivity connection to the provider component.

[Full provide + inject Example with Reactivity](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFUUFugzAQ/MrKF1IpxfeIVKp66Kk/8MWFDXYFtmUbpArx967BhURRU9/WOzO7MzuxV+fKcUB2YlWovXYRAsbBvQije2d9hAk8Xo7gvB11gzDDxdseCuIUG+ZN6a7JjZIvVRIlgDCcw+d3pmvTglz1okJ499I0C3qB1dJQT9YRooVaSdNiACWdQ5OICj2WwtTWhAg9hiBbhHNSOxQKu84WT8LkNQ9FBhTHXyg1K75aJHNUROxdJyNSBVBp44YI43NvG+zOgmWWYGt7dcipqPhGZEe2ef07wN3lltD+lWN6tNkV/37+rdKjK2rzhRTt7f3u41xhe37/xJZGAL2PLECXa9NKdD/a6QTTtGnP88LgiXJtYv4BaLHhvg==)

Again, if not using `<script setup>`, `inject()` should only be called synchronously inside `setup()`:

```js
import { inject } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const message = inject('message')
    return { message }
  }
}
```

#### Injection Default Values

By default, `inject` assumes that the injected key is provided somewhere in the parent chain. In the case where the key is not provided, there will be a runtime warning.

If we want to make an injected property work with optional providers, we need to declare a default value, similar to props:

```js
// `value` will be "default value"
// if no data matching "message" was provided
const value = inject('message', 'default value')
```

In some cases, the default value may need to be created by calling a function or instantiating a new class. To avoid unnecessary computation or side effects in case the optional value is not used, we can use a factory function for creating the default value:

```js
const value = inject('key', () => new ExpensiveClass(), true)
```

The third parameter indicates the default value should be treated as a factory function.

### Working with Reactivity

When using reactive provide / inject values, **it is recommended to keep any mutations to reactive state inside of the _provider_ whenever possible**. This ensures that the provided state and its possible mutations are co-located in the same component, making it easier to maintain in the future.

There may be times when we need to update the data from an injector component. In such cases, we recommend providing a function that is responsible for mutating the state:

```vue{7-9,13}
<!-- inside provider component -->
<script setup>
import { provide, ref } from 'vue'

const location = ref('North Pole')

function updateLocation() {
  location.value = 'South Pole'
}

provide('location', {
  location,
  updateLocation
})
</script>
```

```vue{5}
<!-- in injector component -->
<script setup>
import { inject } from 'vue'

const { location, updateLocation } = inject('location')
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="updateLocation">{{ location }}</button>
</template>
```

Finally, you can wrap the provided value with [`readonly()`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core#readonly) if you want to ensure that the data passed through `provide` cannot be mutated by the injector component.

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, provide, readonly } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
provide('read-only-count', readonly(count))
</script>
```

### Working with Symbol Keys

So far, we have been using string injection keys in the examples. If you are working in a large application with many dependency providers, or you are authoring components that are going to be used by other developers, it is best to use [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) injection keys to avoid potential collisions.

It's recommended to export the Symbols in a dedicated file:

```js
export const myInjectionKey = Symbol()
```

```js
// in provider component
import { provide } from 'vue'
import { myInjectionKey } from './keys.js'

provide(myInjectionKey, {
  /* data to provide */
})
```

```js
// in injector component
import { inject } from 'vue'
import { myInjectionKey } from './keys.js'

const injected = inject(myInjectionKey)
```
