# The Tool-Use Protocol

The model can't run anything itself. It asks, in a structured message, and the harness answers. This module wires that protocol into the loop.

### Only One Tool: Bash

The s01 Agent has only one tool: bash. To read a file, `cat`; to write, `echo "..." > file.py`; to edit, `sed`.

The model thinks "read this file" but has to spell out `cat path/to/file`. An extra layer of translation that wastes tokens and invites errors.

---

### Overview: Tool Dispatch

![Tool Dispatch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shareAI-lab/learn-claude-code/HEAD/s02_tool_use/images/tool-dispatch.en.svg)

The s01 loop is fully preserved (LLM call, `tool_use` block check, message append — not a single word changed). The only change is in that one line of tool execution: `run_bash()` is replaced with `TOOL_HANDLERS[block.name]()` dispatch lookup.

Adding a tool to the Agent requires just two things:

1. **Define the tool**: Add one entry to the `TOOLS` array
2. **Register the handler**: Add one mapping in the `TOOL_HANDLERS` dict

---

### From 1 Tool to 5 Tools

s01 had only bash:

```python
TOOLS = [{"name": "bash", ...}]

def run_bash(command): ...
```

s02 expands to 5 tools, each independently defined:

```python
TOOLS = [
    {"name": "bash",       "description": "Run a shell command.", ...},
    {"name": "read_file",  "description": "Read file contents.",  ...},
    {"name": "write_file", "description": "Write content to file.", ...},
    {"name": "edit_file",  "description": "Replace text in file once.", ...},
    {"name": "glob",       "description": "Find files by pattern.", ...},
]
```

Each tool has its own implementation function:

```python
def run_read(path, limit=None):
    lines = safe_path(path).read_text(encoding="utf-8").splitlines()
    if limit:
        lines = lines[:limit]
    return "\n".join(lines)

def run_write(path, content):
    safe_path(path).write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")
    return f"Wrote {len(content)} bytes to {path}"

def run_edit(path, old_text, new_text):
    text = safe_path(path).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    if old_text not in text:
        return "Error: text not found"
    safe_path(path).write_text(text.replace(old_text, new_text, 1), encoding="utf-8")
    return f"Edited {path}"

def run_glob(pattern):
    import glob as g
    matches = sorted(set(g.glob(
        pattern, root_dir=WORKDIR, recursive=True)))
    shown = matches[:200]
    if len(matches) > 200:
        shown.append("... (more matches omitted; narrow the pattern)")
    return "\n".join(shown)
```

---

### Tool Dispatch

```python
TOOL_HANDLERS = {
    "bash":       run_bash,
    "read_file":  run_read,
    "write_file": run_write,
    "edit_file":  run_edit,
    "glob":       run_glob,
}

# Only one line changed in the loop — from hardcoded run_bash to dispatch lookup:
for block in tool_calls:
    handler = TOOL_HANDLERS[block.name]    # lookup
    output = handler(**block.input)         # call
    results.append(...)
```

Adding a tool = one entry in `TOOLS` array + one line in `TOOL_HANDLERS` dict. The loop stays the same.

---

### Multiple Tool Calls

The model often returns multiple tool_use calls at once — "read a.py and b.py, then list all .py files".

Calls are executed one by one in their original `response.content` order.

---

### Quick Reference

| Concept | One-Liner |
|---------|-----------|
| TOOL_HANDLERS | Tool name → handler function dict. Add a tool = add one mapping line |
| Tool Definition | JSON schema telling the model "what I can do" |
| Multiple tool calls | Model may return multiple tool_use at once; calls execute in their original order |
| Loop Unchanged | s01's `while True` loop — not a single line changed |

---

### Changes from s01

| Component | Before (s01) | After (s02) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Tool count | 1 (bash) | 5 (+read, write, edit, glob) |
| Tool execution | Hardcoded `run_bash()` | TOOL_HANDLERS dispatch lookup |
| Path safety | None | safe_path validation (file tools only) |
| Loop | `while True` + `tool_use` block | Identical to s01 |

---

### Try It

```sh
cd learn-claude-code
python s02_tool_use/code.py
```

Try these prompts:

1. `Read the file README.md and tell me what this project is about`
2. `Create a file called test.py that prints "hello", then read it back`
3. `Find all Python files in this directory`
4. `Read both README.md and requirements.txt, then create a summary file`

What to watch for: When does the model call just one tool, and when does it call multiple at once? Are multiple tool calls executed in the correct order?

---

### What's Next

The Agent now has 5 specialized tools. File tools are protected by `safe_path`, but bash is unrestricted — `rm -rf /` still runs.

→ s03 Permission: Add a gate before tool execution — is this operation safe? Does it need user approval?

### Full code

From [`s02_tool_use/code.py`](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/learn-claude-code/blob/HEAD/s02_tool_use/code.py):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
s02_tool_use.py - Tools

The agent loop from s01 does not change. This lesson adds four tools
and a dispatch map:

    +----------+      +-------+      +--------------------------+
    |   User   | ---> |  LLM  | ---> | Tool Dispatch            |
    |  prompt  |      |       |      | bash       -> run_bash   |
    +----------+      +---+---+      | read_file  -> run_read   |
                          ^          | write_file -> run_write  |
                          |          | edit_file  -> run_edit   |
                          +----------+ glob       -> run_glob   |
                          tool_result+--------------------------+

  + run_read / run_write / run_edit / run_glob
  + TOOL_HANDLERS instead of a hard-coded run_bash call
  + safe_path to keep file tools inside the workspace

Key insight: the loop stays the same; only tool registration and dispatch grow.

## Natural language to tool calls

> **Source:** [Natural language to tool calls](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/HEAD/content/factor-01-natural-language-to-tool-calls.md) · [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents), CC BY-SA 4.0

One of the most common patterns in agent building is to convert natural language to structured tool calls. This is a powerful pattern that allows you to build agents that can reason about tasks and execute them.

![110-natural-language-tool-calls](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/110-natural-language-tool-calls.png)

This pattern, when applied atomically, is the simple translation of a phrase like

> can you create a payment link for $750 to Terri for sponsoring the february AI tinkerers meetup?

to a structured object that describes a Stripe API call like

```json
{
  "function": {
    "name": "create_payment_link",
    "parameters": {
      "amount": 750,
      "customer": "cust_128934ddasf9",
      "product": "prod_8675309",
      "price": "prc_09874329fds",
      "quantity": 1,
      "memo": "Hey Jeff - see below for the payment link for the february ai tinkerers meetup"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: in reality the stripe API is a bit more complex, a [real agent that does this](https://github.com/dexhorthy/mailcrew) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_cKnoPC_Oo)) would list customers, list products, list prices, etc to build this payload with the proper ids, or include those ids in the prompt/context window (we'll see below how those are kinda the same thing though!)

From there, deterministic code can pick up the payload and do something with it. (More on this in [factor 3](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-03-own-your-context-window.md))

```python
# The LLM takes natural language and returns a structured object
nextStep = await llm.determineNextStep(
  """
  create a payment link for $750 to Jeff
  for sponsoring the february AI tinkerers meetup
  """
  )

# Handle the structured output based on its function
if nextStep.function == 'create_payment_link':
    stripe.paymentlinks.create(nextStep.parameters)
    return  # or whatever you want, see below
elif nextStep.function == 'something_else':
    # ... more cases
    pass
else:  # the model didn't call a tool we know about
    # do something else
    pass
```

**NOTE**: While a full agent would then receive the API call result and loop with it, eventually returning something like

> I've successfully created a payment link for $750 to Terri for sponsoring the february AI tinkerers meetup. Here's the link: https://buy.stripe.com/test_1234567890

**Instead**, We're actually going to skip that step here, and save it for another factor, which you may or may not want to also incorporate (up to you!)
