# Express.js

Express is the minimal web framework most Node.js backends start from. Routes map a method and path to a handler, and middleware runs in order on every request.

**Course outline modules:** 4 (Express.js), 6-7 (API Development)

## Hello world

> **Source:** [Hello world](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) · [Express docs](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com), CC BY 4.0

Embedded below is essentially the simplest Express app you can create. It is a single file app
&mdash; _not_ what you'd get if you use the [Express generator](https://expressjs.com/starter/generator), which
creates the scaffolding for a full app with numerous JavaScript files, Jade templates, and
sub-directories for various purposes.

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response } from 'express';

const app: Express = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with "Hello World!" for requests
to the root URL (`/`) or _route_. For every other path, it will respond with a **404 Not Found**.

### Running Locally

First create a directory named `myapp`, change to it and run `npm init`. Then, install `express` as a dependency, as per the [installation guide](https://expressjs.com/starter/installing).

In the `myapp` directory, create a file named `app.js` and copy the code from the example above.

The `req` (request) and `res` (response) are the exact same objects that Node provides, so you can
invoke `req.pipe()`, `req.on('data', callback)`, and anything else you would do without Express
involved.

Run the app with the following command:

```bash
$ node app.js
```

Then, load `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser to see the output.

## Basic routing

> **Source:** [Basic routing](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html) · [Express docs](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com), CC BY 4.0

_Routing_ refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure:

```js
app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER);
```

Where:

- `app` is an instance of `express`.
- `METHOD` is an [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods), in lowercase.
- `PATH` is a path on the server.
- `HANDLER` is the function executed when the route is matched.

This tutorial assumes that an instance of `express` named `app` is created and the server is
running. If you are not familiar with creating an app and starting it, see the [Hello world
example](https://expressjs.com/starter/hello-world).

The following examples illustrate defining simple routes.

Respond with `Hello World!` on the homepage:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});
```

Respond to a POST request on the root route (`/`), the application's home page:

```js
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Got a POST request');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.post('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Got a POST request');
});
```

Respond to a PUT request to the `/user` route:

```js
app.put('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Got a PUT request at /user');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.put('/user', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Got a PUT request at /user');
});
```

Respond to a DELETE request to the `/user` route:

```js
app.delete('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Got a DELETE request at /user');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.delete('/user', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Got a DELETE request at /user');
});
```

For more details about routing, see the [Routing](https://expressjs.com/guide/routing) guide.

## Routing

> **Source:** [Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) · [Express docs](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com), CC BY 4.0

_Routing_ refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.
For an introduction to routing, see [Basic routing](https://expressjs.com/starter/basic-routing).

You define routing using methods of the Express `app` object that correspond to HTTP methods;
for example, `app.get()` to handle GET requests and `app.post` to handle POST requests. For a full list,
see [app.METHOD](https://expressjs.com/api/application#appmethod). You can also use [app.all()](https://expressjs.com/api/application#appall) to handle all HTTP methods and [app.use()](https://expressjs.com/api/application#appuse) to
specify middleware as the callback function (See [Using middleware](https://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware) for details).

These routing methods specify a callback function (sometimes called a "handler function") that Express automatically runs when the application receives a request matching the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method. In other words, the application "listens" for requests that match the specified route(s) and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback function.

In fact, the routing methods can have more than one callback function as arguments.
With multiple callback functions, it is important to provide `next` as an argument to the callback function and then call `next()` within the body of the function to hand off control
to the next callback.

The following code is an example of a very basic route.

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// respond with "hello world" when a GET request is made to the homepage
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hello world');
});
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// respond with "hello world" when a GET request is made to the homepage
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hello world');
});
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response } from 'express';

const app: Express = express();

// respond with "hello world" when a GET request is made to the homepage
app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('hello world');
});
```

### Route methods

A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the `express` class.

The following code is an example of routes that are defined for the `GET` and the `POST` methods to the root of the app.

```js
// GET method route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to the homepage');
});

// POST method route
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to the homepage');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

// GET method route
app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('GET request to the homepage');
});

// POST method route
app.post('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('POST request to the homepage');
});
```

Express supports methods that correspond to all HTTP request methods: `get`, `post`, and so on.
For a full list, see [app.METHOD](https://expressjs.com/api/application#appmethod).

There is a special routing method, `app.all()`, used to load middleware functions at a path for _all_ HTTP request methods. For example, the following handler is executed for requests to the route `"/secret"` whether using `GET`, `QUERY`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, or any other HTTP request method supported in the [http module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpmethods).

```js
app.all('/secret', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...');
  next(); // pass control to the next handler
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.all('/secret', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...');
  next(); // pass control to the next handler
});
```

### Route paths

Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings or regular expressions. They can also capture values from the URL, as described in [Route parameters](#route-parameters) below.

Express uses [path-to-regexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp) v8 for matching the route paths; see the path-to-regexp documentation for all the possibilities in defining route paths.
[Express Playground Router](https://bjohansebas.github.io/playground-router/) is a handy tool for testing basic Express routes, although it does not support pattern matching.

#### String paths

String paths match requests exactly. The dot (`.`) and hyphen (`-`) are interpreted literally.

Query strings are not part of the route path.

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('root');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('about');
});

app.get('/random.text', (req, res) => {
  res.send('random.text');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('root');
});

app.get('/about', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('about');
});

app.get('/random.text', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('random.text');
});
```

The characters `?`, `+`, `*`, `[]`, `()`, and `!` are reserved and cannot be used as literal characters in route paths, and braces are reserved for [optional segments](#optional-segments). Use `\` to escape them if needed.

#### Regular expressions

You can also use regular expressions as route paths. This is useful when you need more complex matching logic.

```js
// Matches any path containing "a"
app.get(/a/, (req, res) => {
  res.send('/a/');
});

// Matches paths ending with "fly" (butterfly, dragonfly, etc.)
app.get(/.*fly$/, (req, res) => {
  res.send('/.*fly$/');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

// Matches any path containing "a"
app.get(/a/, (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('/a/');
});

// Matches paths ending with "fly" (butterfly, dragonfly, etc.)
app.get(/.*fly$/, (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('/.*fly$/');
});
```

### Route parameters

Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the `req.params` object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys. They come in three forms: [named parameters](#named-parameters) (`:name`), [wildcards](#wildcards) (`*name`), and [optional segments](#optional-segments), which wrap either of them in braces.

#### Named parameters

Named parameters capture a single path segment at their position in the URL, or part of one when combined with literal characters, as shown further below.

```
Route path: /users/:userId/books/:bookId
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/34/books/8989
req.params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }
```

To define routes with route parameters, simply specify the route parameters in the path of the route as shown below.

```js
app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.params);
});
```

In TypeScript, `@types/express` infers the parameters from the route path, so in the handler above
`req.params.userId` and `req.params.bookId` are already typed as `string` with no extra annotation.
Reading a name that is not in the route (such as `req.params.other`) is a type error. You only need
to annotate the parameters when the handler is defined separately from the route, because the type
checker can no longer see the path. In that case, pass them as the first type argument of `Request`:

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

const sendParams = (req: Request<{ userId: string; bookId: string }>, res: Response) => {
  res.send(req.params);
};

app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', sendParams);
```

The name of route parameters must be a valid JavaScript identifier. Other names can be used by quoting them, for example `:"user-name"`.

Since the hyphen (`-`) and the dot (`.`) are interpreted literally, they can be used along with route parameters for useful purposes.

```
Route path: /flights/:from-:to
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/flights/LAX-SFO
req.params: { "from": "LAX", "to": "SFO" }
```

```
Route path: /plantae/:genus.:species
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/plantae/Prunus.persica
req.params: { "genus": "Prunus", "species": "persica" }
```

Regexp characters are not supported inside string paths, so a parameter cannot be restricted with a suffix such as `:userId(\d+)`. Use an array of paths or a full regular expression instead.
See the [path route matching syntax](https://expressjs.com/guide/migrating-5#path-route-matching-syntax) for more information.

#### Wildcards

Wildcards match any path after a prefix. Like other route parameters they must have a name, but they are captured as an array of path segments instead of a string.

```js
app.get('/files/*filepath', (req, res) => {
  // GET /files/images/logo.png
  console.dir(req.params.filepath);
  // => [ 'images', 'logo.png' ]
  res.send(`File: ${req.params.filepath.join('/')}`);
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/files/*filepath', (req: Request<{ filepath: string[] }>, res: Response) => {
  // GET /files/images/logo.png
  console.dir(req.params.filepath);
  // => [ 'images', 'logo.png' ]
  res.send(`File: ${req.params.filepath.join('/')}`);
});
```

To also match the root path, wrap the wildcard in braces:

```js
// Matches / , /foo , /foo/bar , etc.
app.get('/{*splat}', (req, res) => {
  // GET / => req.params = {}, splat is omitted
  // GET /foo/bar => req.params.splat = [ 'foo', 'bar' ]
  res.send('ok');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

// Matches / , /foo , /foo/bar , etc.
app.get('/{*splat}', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // GET / => req.params = {}, splat is omitted
  // GET /foo/bar => req.params.splat = [ 'foo', 'bar' ]
  res.send('ok');
});
```

#### Optional segments

Use braces to define optional segments in a route path. When the segment is not present, the parameter is omitted from `req.params`.

```js
app.get('/:file{.:ext}', (req, res) => {
  // GET /image.png => req.params = { file: 'image', ext: 'png' }
  // GET /image => req.params = { file: 'image' }
  res.send('ok');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/:file{.:ext}', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // GET /image.png => req.params = { file: 'image', ext: 'png' }
  // GET /image => req.params = { file: 'image' }
  res.send('ok');
});
```

The braces can also wrap a whole parameter to make it optional. Note that everything inside the braces is optional, so the position of the slash matters:

```js
app.get('/user/{:id}', (req, res) => {
  // GET /user/42 => req.params = { id: '42' }
  // GET /user/ => req.params = {}
  // GET /user => 404, only the parameter is optional
  res.send('ok');
});

app.get('/order{/:id}', (req, res) => {
  // GET /order/42 => req.params = { id: '42' }
  // GET /order => req.params = {}, the whole segment is optional
  res.send('ok');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/user/{:id}', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // GET /user/42 => req.params = { id: '42' }
  // GET /user/ => req.params = {}
  // GET /user => 404, only the parameter is optional
  res.send('ok');
});

app.get('/order{/:id}', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // GET /order/42 => req.params = { id: '42' }
  // GET /order => req.params = {}, the whole segment is optional
  res.send('ok');
});
```

Do not confuse the position of the slash in the route path with the [`strict routing` setting](https://expressjs.com/api/application/#application-settings), which is about the request URL: it controls whether a URL ending in a slash that the route path does not require still matches. For example, a request for `/order/` matches the `/order{/:id}` route by default, but returns a 404 error when strict routing is enabled; the trailing slash of `/user/` is unaffected because the `/user/{:id}` route requires it. All the requests commented in the examples above behave the same regardless of that setting.

### Route handlers

You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like [middleware](https://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware) to handle a request. The only exception is that these callbacks might invoke `next('route')` to bypass the remaining route callbacks. You can use this mechanism to impose pre-conditions on a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if there's no reason to proceed with the current route.

```js
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.params.id === '0') {
    return next('route');
  }
  res.send(`User ${req.params.id}`);
});

app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Special handler for user ID 0');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get('/user/:id', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  if (req.params.id === '0') {
    return next('route');
  }
  res.send(`User ${req.params.id}`);
});

app.get('/user/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Special handler for user ID 0');
});
```

In this example:

- `GET /user/5` → handled by first route → sends "User 5"
- `GET /user/0` → first route calls `next('route')`, skipping to the next matching `/user/:id` route

Route handlers can be in the form of a function, an array of functions, or combinations of both, as shown in the following examples.

A single callback function can handle a route. For example:

```js
app.get('/example/a', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from A!');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/example/a', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Hello from A!');
});
```

More than one callback function can handle a route (make sure you specify the `next` object). For example:

```js
app.get(
  '/example/b',
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('the response will be sent by the next function ...');
    next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello from B!');
  }
);
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get(
  '/example/b',
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.log('the response will be sent by the next function ...');
    next();
  },
  (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send('Hello from B!');
  }
);
```

An array of callback functions can handle a route. For example:

```js
const cb0 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB0');
  next();
};

const cb1 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB1');
  next();
};

const cb2 = function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello from C!');
};

app.get('/example/c', [cb0, cb1, cb2]);
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const cb0 = function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('CB0');
  next();
};

const cb1 = function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('CB1');
  next();
};

const cb2 = function (req: Request, res: Response) {
  res.send('Hello from C!');
};

app.get('/example/c', [cb0, cb1, cb2]);
```

A combination of independent functions and arrays of functions can handle a route. For example:

```js
const cb0 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB0');
  next();
};

const cb1 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB1');
  next();
};

app.get(
  '/example/d',
  [cb0, cb1],
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('the response will be sent by the next function ...');
    next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello from D!');
  }
);
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const cb0 = function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('CB0');
  next();
};

const cb1 = function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('CB1');
  next();
};

app.get(
  '/example/d',
  [cb0, cb1],
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.log('the response will be sent by the next function ...');
    next();
  },
  (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send('Hello from D!');
  }
);
```

### Response methods

The methods on the [response object](https://expressjs.com/api/response) (`res`) in the following table can send a response to the client, and terminate the request-response cycle. If none of these methods are called from a route handler, the client request will be left hanging.

| Method                                          | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [res.download()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#resdownload)     | Prompt a file to be downloaded.                                                       |
| [res.end()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#resend)               | End the response process.                                                             |
| [res.json()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#resjson)             | Send a JSON response.                                                                 |
| [res.jsonp()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#resjsonp)           | Send a JSON response with JSONP support.                                              |
| [res.redirect()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#resredirect)     | Redirect a request.                                                                   |
| [res.render()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#resrender)         | Render a view template.                                                               |
| [res.send()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#ressend)             | Send a response of various types.                                                     |
| [res.sendFile()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#ressendfile)     | Send a file as an octet stream.                                                       |
| [res.sendStatus()](https://expressjs.com/api/response#ressendstatus) | Set the response status code and send its string representation as the response body. |

### app.route()

You can create chainable route handlers for a route path by using `app.route()`.
Because the path is specified in a single location, this helps to create modular routes and reduces redundancy and typos. For more information about routes, see the [Router() documentation](https://expressjs.com/api/router).

Here is an example of chained route handlers that are defined by using `app.route()`.

```js
app
  .route('/book')
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send('Get a random book');
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.send('Add a book');
  })
  .put((req, res) => {
    res.send('Update the book');
  });
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app
  .route('/book')
  .get((req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send('Get a random book');
  })
  .post((req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send('Add a book');
  })
  .put((req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send('Update the book');
  });

### express.Router

Use the `express.Router` class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A `Router` instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a "mini-app".

The following example creates a router as a module, loads a middleware function in it, defines some routes, and mounts the router module on a path in the main app.

Create a router file named `birds.js` in the app directory, with the following content:

```cjs title="birds.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// middleware that is specific to this router
const timeLog = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now());
  next();
};
router.use(timeLog);

// define the home page route
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Birds home page');
});
// define the about route
router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About birds');
});

module.exports = router;
```

```mjs title="birds.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const router = express.Router();

// middleware that is specific to this router
const timeLog = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now());
  next();
};
router.use(timeLog);

// define the home page route
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Birds home page');
});
// define the about route
router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About birds');
});

export default router;
```

```ts title="birds.ts"
import express, { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const router = express.Router();

// middleware that is specific to this router
const timeLog = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now());
  next();
};
router.use(timeLog);

// define the home page route
router.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Birds home page');
});
// define the about route
router.get('/about', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('About birds');
});

export default router;
```

Then, load the router module in the app:

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const birds = require('./birds');

// ...

app.use('/birds', birds);
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import birds from './birds';

// ...

app.use('/birds', birds);
```

The app will now be able to handle requests to `/birds` and `/birds/about`, as well as call the `timeLog` middleware function that is specific to the route.

But if the parent route `/birds` has path parameters, it will not be accessible by default from the sub-routes. To make it accessible, you will need to pass the `mergeParams` option to the [Router constructor](https://expressjs.com/api/express/#expressrouter).

```js
const router = express.Router({ mergeParams: true });
```

## Writing middleware

> **Source:** [Writing middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) · [Express docs](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com), CC BY 4.0

_Middleware_ functions are functions that have access to the [request object](https://expressjs.com/api/request) (`req`), the [response object](https://expressjs.com/api/response) (`res`), and the `next` function in the application's request-response cycle. The `next` function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

The following figure shows the elements of a middleware function call:

![Elements of a middleware function call](https://expressjs.com/images/express-mw.png)

Starting with Express 5, middleware functions that return a Promise will call `next(value)` when they reject or throw an error. `next` will be called with either the rejected value or the thrown Error.

### Example

Here is an example of a simple "Hello World" Express application.
The remainder of this article will define and add three middleware functions to the application:
one called `myLogger` that prints a simple log message, one called `requestTime` that
displays the timestamp of the HTTP request, and one called `validateCookies` that validates incoming cookies.

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response } from 'express';

const app: Express = express();

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

#### Middleware function myLogger

Here is a simple example of a middleware function called "myLogger". This function just prints
"LOGGED" when a request to the app passes through it. The middleware function is assigned to a
variable named `myLogger`.

```js
const myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('LOGGED');
  next();
};
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const myLogger = function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('LOGGED');
  next();
};
```

Here `myLogger` is defined on its own rather than passed directly to `app.use()`, so TypeScript has
no context to infer its parameters and they are annotated explicitly. You can instead type the whole
function as `RequestHandler`, which types `req`, `res`, and `next` for you. When the middleware is
written inline in the `app.use()` call, Express infers those three parameters and no annotations are
needed.

Notice the call above to `next()`. Calling this function invokes the next middleware function in
the app. The `next()` function is not a part of the Node.js or Express API, but is the third
argument that is passed to the middleware function. The `next()` function could be named anything,
but by convention it is always named "next". To avoid confusion, always use this convention.

To load the middleware function, call `app.use()`, specifying the middleware function.
For example, the following code loads the `myLogger` middleware function before the route to the root path (/).

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('LOGGED');
  next();
};

app.use(myLogger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

const myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('LOGGED');
  next();
};

app.use(myLogger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const app: Express = express();

const myLogger = function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('LOGGED');
  next();
};

app.use(myLogger);

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Every time the app receives a request, it prints the message "LOGGED" to the terminal.

The order of middleware loading is important: middleware functions that are loaded first are also executed first.

If `myLogger` is loaded after the route to the root path, the request never reaches it and the app doesn't print "LOGGED", because the route handler of the root path terminates the request-response cycle.

The middleware function `myLogger` simply prints a message, then passes on the request to the next middleware function in the stack by calling the `next()` function.

#### Middleware function requestTime

Next, we'll create a middleware function called "requestTime" and add a property called `requestTime`
to the [request object](https://expressjs.com/api/request).

Because the middleware adds a property to `req`, extend the request type in TypeScript with
[declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html). Declare
the property (as optional, since a middleware may not run for every request) in a `.d.ts` file that
is part of your project:

```ts title="types/express.d.ts"
declare global {
  namespace Express {
    interface Request {
      requestTime?: number;
    }
  }
}

export {};
```

TypeScript picks up the file automatically, so no `tsconfig.json` change is needed unless you have
set a custom `include` that does not cover its location. See
[Extending the API in TypeScript](https://expressjs.com/guide/overriding-express-api#extending-the-api-in-typescript) for
adding other custom properties and methods.

```js
const requestTime = function (req, res, next) {
  req.requestTime = Date.now();
  next();
};
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const requestTime = function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  req.requestTime = Date.now();
  next();
};
```

The app now uses the `requestTime` middleware function. Also, the callback function of the root path route uses the property that the middleware function adds to `req` (the request object).

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const requestTime = function (req, res, next) {
  req.requestTime = Date.now();
  next();
};

app.use(requestTime);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  let responseText = 'Hello World!<br>';
  responseText += `<small>Requested at: ${req.requestTime}</small>`;
  res.send(responseText);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

const requestTime = function (req, res, next) {
  req.requestTime = Date.now();
  next();
};

app.use(requestTime);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  let responseText = 'Hello World!<br>';
  responseText += `<small>Requested at: ${req.requestTime}</small>`;
  res.send(responseText);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const app: Express = express();

const requestTime = function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  req.requestTime = Date.now();
  next();
};

app.use(requestTime);

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  let responseText = 'Hello World!<br>';
  responseText += `<small>Requested at: ${req.requestTime}</small>`;
  res.send(responseText);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

When you make a request to the root of the app, the app now displays the timestamp of your request in the browser.

#### Middleware function validateCookies

Finally, we'll create a middleware function that validates incoming cookies and sends a 400 response if cookies are invalid.

Here's an example function that validates cookies with an external async service.

```js
async function cookieValidator(cookies) {
  try {
    await externallyValidateCookie(cookies.testCookie);
  } catch {
    throw new Error('Invalid cookies');
  }
}
```

```ts
async function cookieValidator(cookies: Record<string, string>) {
  try {
    await externallyValidateCookie(cookies.testCookie);
  } catch {
    throw new Error('Invalid cookies');
  }
}
```

Here, we use the [`cookie-parser`](https://expressjs.com/resources/middleware/cookie-parser) middleware to parse incoming cookies off the `req` object and pass them to our `cookieValidator` function. The `validateCookies` middleware returns a Promise that upon rejection will automatically trigger our error handler.

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const cookieValidator = require('./cookieValidator');

const app = express();

async function validateCookies(req, res, next) {
  await cookieValidator(req.cookies);
  next();
}

app.use(cookieParser());

app.use(validateCookies);

// error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(400).send(err.message);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';
import cookieValidator from './cookieValidator';

const app = express();

async function validateCookies(req, res, next) {
  await cookieValidator(req.cookies);
  next();
}

app.use(cookieParser());

app.use(validateCookies);

// error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(400).send(err.message);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';
import cookieValidator from './cookieValidator';

const app: Express = express();

async function validateCookies(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  await cookieValidator(req.cookies);
  next();
}

app.use(cookieParser());

app.use(validateCookies);

// error handler
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  res.status(400).send(err.message);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Note how `next()` is called after `await cookieValidator(req.cookies)`. This ensures that if
`cookieValidator` resolves, the next middleware in the stack will get called. If you pass anything
to the `next()` function (except the string `'route'` or `'router'`), Express regards the current
request as being an error and will skip any remaining non-error handling routing and middleware
functions.

Because you have access to the [request object](https://expressjs.com/api/request), the [response object](https://expressjs.com/api/response), the next middleware function in the stack, and the whole [Node.js API](https://nodejs.org/api/), the possibilities with middleware functions are endless.

For more information about Express middleware, see the [Using Express middleware](https://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware) guide.

### Configurable middleware

If you need your middleware to be configurable, export a function which accepts an options object or other parameters, which, then returns the middleware implementation based on the input parameters.

```cjs title="my-middleware.cjs"
module.exports = function (options) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    // Implement the middleware function based on the options object
    next();
  };
};
```

```mjs title="my-middleware.mjs"
export default function (options) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    // Implement the middleware function based on the options object
    next();
  };
}
```

```ts title="my-middleware.ts"
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

export default function (options: Record<string, unknown>) {
  return function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    // Implement the middleware function based on the options object
    next();
  };
}
```

The middleware can now be used as shown below.

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const mw = require('./my-middleware.cjs');

app.use(mw({ option1: '1', option2: '2' }));
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import mw from './my-middleware.mjs';

app.use(mw({ option1: '1', option2: '2' }));
```

Refer to [cookie-session](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session) and [compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) for examples of configurable middleware.

## Using middleware

> **Source:** [Using middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) · [Express docs](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com), CC BY 4.0

Express is a routing and middleware web framework with minimal functionality of its own: an Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls executed during the request-response cycle.

_Middleware_ functions are functions that have access to:

- The [request object](https://expressjs.com/api/request) (`req`)
- The [response object](https://expressjs.com/api/response) (`res`)
- The next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle, commonly named `next`

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Modify the request and response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Pass control to the next middleware function.

If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

- [Application-level middleware](#application-level-middleware)
- [Router-level middleware](#router-level-middleware)
- [Error-handling middleware](#error-handling-middleware)
- [Built-in middleware](#built-in-middleware)
- [Third-party middleware](#third-party-middleware)

You can load application-level and router-level middleware with an optional mount path. Multiple middleware functions can also be loaded together, which creates a middleware sub-stack at a mount point.

### Application-level middleware

Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the [app object](https://expressjs.com/api/application) by using the `app.use()` and `app.METHOD()` functions, where `METHOD` is the lowercase HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles, such as `get`, `post`, `put`, or `delete`.

#### Middleware without a mount path

The following middleware function runs every time the app receives a request:

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const app: Express = express();

app.use((req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});
```

#### Middleware mounted on a path

The following middleware function runs for any type of HTTP request on the `/user/:id` path:

```js
app.use('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  next();
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.use('/user/:id', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  next();
});
```

#### Route handlers

This example shows a route and its handler function (middleware system). The function handles GET requests to the `/user/:id` path:

```js
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send('USER');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/user/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('USER');
});
```

#### Middleware sub-stacks

Multiple middleware functions can be loaded together at a mount point to form a middleware sub-stack. This example prints request info for any type of HTTP request to the `/user/:id` path:

```js
app.use(
  '/user/:id',
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
    next();
  }
);
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.use(
  '/user/:id',
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
    next();
  },
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
    next();
  }
);
```

#### Multiple route handlers

Route handlers enable you to define multiple routes for a path. The example below defines two routes for GET requests to the `/user/:id` path. The second route will not cause any problems, but it will never get called because the first route ends the request-response cycle.

```js
app.get(
  '/user/:id',
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('ID:', req.params.id);
    next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    res.send('User Info');
  }
);

// handler for the /user/:id path, which prints the user ID
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.params.id);
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get(
  '/user/:id',
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.log('ID:', req.params.id);
    next();
  },
  (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send('User Info');
  }
);

// handler for the /user/:id path, which prints the user ID
app.get('/user/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send(req.params.id);
});
```

#### Skipping to the next route

Call `next('route')` to skip the remaining middleware functions in a router middleware stack and pass control to the next route.

`next('route')` will work only in middleware functions that were loaded by using the
`app.METHOD()` or `router.METHOD()` functions.

In the following example, if the user ID is `0`, the first handler skips to the next route, which sends a special response:

```js
app.get(
  '/user/:id',
  (req, res, next) => {
    // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
    if (req.params.id === '0') next('route');
    // otherwise pass the control to the next middleware function in this stack
    else next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    // send a regular response
    res.send('regular');
  }
);

// handler for the /user/:id path, which sends a special response
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send('special');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get(
  '/user/:id',
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
    if (req.params.id === '0') next('route');
    // otherwise pass the control to the next middleware function in this stack
    else next();
  },
  (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    // send a regular response
    res.send('regular');
  }
);

// handler for the /user/:id path, which sends a special response
app.get('/user/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('special');
});
```

#### Reusable middleware arrays

Middleware functions can also be grouped into arrays for better reusability. This example shows an array with a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the `/user/:id` path:

```js
function logOriginalUrl(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
  next();
}

function logMethod(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  next();
}

const logStuff = [logOriginalUrl, logMethod];
app.get('/user/:id', logStuff, (req, res) => {
  res.send('User Info');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

function logOriginalUrl(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
  next();
}

function logMethod(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  next();
}

const logStuff = [logOriginalUrl, logMethod];
app.get('/user/:id', logStuff, (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('User Info');
});
```

### Router-level middleware

Router-level middleware works the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of `express.Router()`.

```js
const router = express.Router();
```

```ts
import express from 'express';

const router = express.Router();
```

Load router-level middleware by using the `router.use()` and `router.METHOD()` functions.

The following example code replicates the middleware system that is shown above for application-level middleware, by using router-level middleware:

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

// a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});

// a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path
router.use(
  '/user/:id',
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
    next();
  }
);

// a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path
router.get(
  '/user/:id',
  (req, res, next) => {
    // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
    if (req.params.id === '0') next('route');
    // otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack
    else next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    // render a regular page
    res.render('regular');
  }
);

// handler for the /user/:id path, which renders a special page
router.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params.id);
  res.render('special');
});

// mount the router on the app
app.use('/', router);
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

// a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});

// a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path
router.use(
  '/user/:id',
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
    next();
  }
);

// a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path
router.get(
  '/user/:id',
  (req, res, next) => {
    // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
    if (req.params.id === '0') next('route');
    // otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack
    else next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    // render a regular page
    res.render('regular');
  }
);

// handler for the /user/:id path, which renders a special page
router.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params.id);
  res.render('special');
});

// mount the router on the app
app.use('/', router);
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const app: Express = express();
const router = express.Router();

// a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router
router.use((req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});

// a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path
router.use(
  '/user/:id',
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
    next();
  },
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
    next();
  }
);

// a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path
router.get(
  '/user/:id',
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
    if (req.params.id === '0') next('route');
    // otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack
    else next();
  },
  (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    // render a regular page
    res.render('regular');
  }
);

// handler for the /user/:id path, which renders a special page
router.get('/user/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log(req.params.id);
  res.render('special');
});

// mount the router on the app
app.use('/', router);
```

#### Skipping out of a router

Use `next('router')` to skip the rest of the router's middleware functions and pass control back out of the router instance.

In the following example, the router only responds when the request includes an `x-auth` header. Otherwise, `next('router')` exits the router and the app responds with a 401 status:

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

// predicate the router with a check and bail out when needed
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers['x-auth']) return next('router');
  next();
});

router.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hello, user!');
});

// use the router and 401 anything falling through
app.use('/admin', router, (req, res) => {
  res.sendStatus(401);
});
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

// predicate the router with a check and bail out when needed
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers['x-auth']) return next('router');
  next();
});

router.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hello, user!');
});

// use the router and 401 anything falling through
app.use('/admin', router, (req, res) => {
  res.sendStatus(401);
});
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express, type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

const app: Express = express();
const router = express.Router();

// predicate the router with a check and bail out when needed
router.use((req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  if (!req.headers['x-auth']) return next('router');
  next();
});

router.get('/user/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('hello, user!');
});

// use the router and 401 anything falling through
app.use('/admin', router, (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.sendStatus(401);
});
```

### Error-handling middleware

Define error-handling middleware functions in the same way as other middleware functions, except with four arguments instead of three, specifically with the signature `(err, req, res, next)`:

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

Error-handling middleware always takes _four_ arguments. You must provide four arguments to
identify it as an error-handling middleware function. Even if you don't need to use the `next`
object, you must specify it to maintain the signature. Otherwise, the `next` object will be
interpreted as regular middleware and will fail to handle errors.

For more information, see the [Error handling](https://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling) guide.

### Built-in middleware

Express has the following built-in middleware functions:

- [express.static](https://expressjs.com/api/express/#expressstatic) serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on.
- [express.json](https://expressjs.com/api/express/#expressjson) parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
- [express.raw](https://expressjs.com/api/express/#expressraw) parses incoming requests with Buffer payloads.
- [express.text](https://expressjs.com/api/express/#expresstext) parses incoming requests with text payloads.
- [express.urlencoded](https://expressjs.com/api/express/#expressurlencoded) parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.

### Third-party middleware

Use third-party middleware to add functionality to Express apps.

Install the Node.js module for the required functionality, then load it in your app at the application level or at the router level.

The following example illustrates installing and loading the cookie-parsing middleware function `cookie-parser`:

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

// load the cookie-parsing middleware
app.use(cookieParser());
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import express from 'express';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

const app = express();

// load the cookie-parsing middleware
app.use(cookieParser());
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import express, { type Express } from 'express';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

const app: Express = express();

// load the cookie-parsing middleware
app.use(cookieParser());
```

For a partial list of third-party middleware functions that are commonly used with Express, see the [Third-party middleware](https://expressjs.com/resources/middleware) page.

## Error handling

> **Source:** [Error handling](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html) · [Express docs](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com), CC BY 4.0

_Error Handling_ refers to how Express catches and processes errors that
occur both synchronously and asynchronously. Express comes with a default error
handler so you don't need to write your own to get started.

### Catching Errors

It's important to ensure that Express catches all errors that occur while
running route handlers and middleware.

#### Errors in synchronous code

Errors that occur in synchronous code inside route handlers and middleware
require no extra work. If synchronous code throws an error, then Express will
catch and process it. For example:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error('BROKEN'); // Express will catch this on its own.
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  throw new Error('BROKEN'); // Express will catch this on its own.
});
```

#### Errors in asynchronous code

The recommended way to write asynchronous handlers is with `async` functions.
Route handlers and middleware that return a Promise call `next(value)`
automatically when they reject or throw an error, and `async` functions always
return a Promise, so their errors reach Express with no extra work. For example:

```js
app.get('/user/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUserById(req.params.id);
  res.send(user);
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/user/:id', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const user = await getUserById(req.params.id);
  res.send(user);
});
```

If `getUserById` throws an error or rejects, `next` will be called with either
the thrown error or the rejected value. If no rejected value is provided, `next`
will be called with a default Error object provided by the Express router.

If you pass anything to the `next()` function (except the string `'route'`),
Express regards the current request as being an error and will skip any
remaining non-error handling routing and middleware functions.

#### Working with promise chains

If you build a promise chain instead of using an `async` function, return the
promise from the handler and Express will likewise call `next` automatically
when it rejects:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  return Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    throw new Error('BROKEN'); // Express will catch this and call next.
  });
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  return Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    throw new Error('BROKEN'); // Express will catch this and call next.
  });
});
```

If the promise is not returned, Express does not know it exists, and you must
route the error yourself by providing `next` as the final catch handler.
Without it, the rejection would be unhandled and crash the process:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  Promise.resolve()
    .then(() => {
      throw new Error('BROKEN');
    })
    .catch(next); // Errors will be passed to Express.
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  Promise.resolve()
    .then(() => {
      throw new Error('BROKEN');
    })
    .catch(next); // Errors will be passed to Express.
});
```

This works because if a callback in the promise chain throws, the chain turns that exception into a rejection, which travels down to the final `.catch`. There, `.catch` calls its handler with the error as the first argument, which is exactly the argument `next` expects, so the error reaches Express.

#### Working with callback APIs

Errors produced by callback-based APIs, such as those in `node:fs`, are not
thrown and are not part of any promise. The callback receives them as its first
argument, and you must pass them to the `next()` function yourself, where
Express will catch and process them. For example:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  fs.readFile('/file-does-not-exist', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      next(err); // Pass errors to Express.
    } else {
      res.send(data);
    }
  });
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  fs.readFile('/file-does-not-exist', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      next(err); // Pass errors to Express.
    } else {
      res.send(data);
    }
  });
});
```

If the callback in a sequence provides no data, only errors, you can simplify
this code as follows:

```js
app.get('/', [
  function (req, res, next) {
    fs.writeFile('/inaccessible-path', 'data', next);
  },
  function (req, res) {
    res.send('OK');
  },
]);
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get('/', [
  function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    fs.writeFile('/inaccessible-path', 'data', next);
  },
  function (req: Request, res: Response) {
    res.send('OK');
  },
]);
```

In the above example, `next` is provided as the callback for `fs.writeFile`,
which is called with or without errors. If there is no error, the second
handler is executed, otherwise Express catches and processes the error.

You could also use a chain of handlers to rely on synchronous error
catching, by reducing the asynchronous code to something trivial. For example:

```js
app.get('/', [
  function (req, res, next) {
    fs.readFile('/maybe-valid-file', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
      res.locals.data = data;
      next(err);
    });
  },
  function (req, res) {
    res.locals.data = res.locals.data.split(',')[1];
    res.send(res.locals.data);
  },
]);
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get('/', [
  function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    fs.readFile('/maybe-valid-file', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
      res.locals.data = data;
      next(err);
    });
  },
  function (req: Request, res: Response) {
    res.locals.data = res.locals.data.split(',')[1];
    res.send(res.locals.data);
  },
]);
```

The above example contains a couple of trivial statements following the `readFile`
call. If `readFile` causes an error, then it passes the error to Express, otherwise you
quickly return to the world of synchronous error handling in the next handler
in the chain. Then, the example above tries to process the data. If this fails, then the
synchronous error handler will catch it. If you had done this processing inside
the `readFile` callback, then the application might exit and the Express error
handlers would not run.

Finally, for asynchronous code that provides no error-first callback, such as a
timer, catch errors inside the asynchronous code itself and pass them to
Express:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      throw new Error('BROKEN');
    } catch (err) {
      next(err);
    }
  }, 100);
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      throw new Error('BROKEN');
    } catch (err) {
      next(err);
    }
  }, 100);
});
```

The above example uses a `try...catch` block to catch errors in the
asynchronous code and pass them to Express. If the `try...catch`
block were omitted, Express would not catch the error since it is not part of the synchronous
handler code.

Whichever method you use, if you want Express error handlers to be called in and the
application to survive, you must ensure that Express receives the error.

### The default error handler

Express comes with a built-in error handler that takes care of any errors that might be encountered in the app. This default error-handling middleware function is added at the end of the middleware function stack.

If you pass an error to `next()` and you do not handle it in a custom error
handler, it will be handled by the built-in error handler; the error will be
written to the client with the stack trace. The stack trace is not included
in the production environment.

Set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production`, to run the app in production mode.

When an error is written, the following information is added to the
response:

- The `res.statusCode` is set from `err.status` (or `err.statusCode`). If
  this value is outside the 4xx or 5xx range, it will be set to 500.
- The `res.statusMessage` is set according to the status code.
- The body will be the HTML of the status code message when in production
  environment, otherwise will be `err.stack`.
- Any headers specified in an `err.headers` object.

If you call `next()` with an error after you have started writing the
response (for example, if you encounter an error while streaming the
response to the client), the Express default error handler closes the
connection and fails the request.

So when you add a custom error handler, you must delegate to
the default Express error handler, when the headers
have already been sent to the client:

```js
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  if (res.headersSent) {
    return next(err);
  }
  res.status(500);
  res.render('error', { error: err });
}
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

function errorHandler(err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  if (res.headersSent) {
    return next(err);
  }
  res.status(500);
  res.render('error', { error: err });
}
```

Note that the default error handler can get triggered if you call `next()` with an error
in your code more than once, even if custom error handling middleware is in place.

Other error handling middleware can be found at [Express middleware](https://expressjs.com/resources/middleware).

### Writing error handlers

Define error-handling middleware functions in the same way as other middleware functions,
except error-handling functions have four arguments instead of three:
`(err, req, res, next)`. For example:

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

You define error-handling middleware last, after other `app.use()` and routes calls; for example:

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const methodOverride = require('method-override');

app.use(
  bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
  })
);
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(methodOverride());
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // logic
});
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import methodOverride from 'method-override';

app.use(
  bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
  })
);
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(methodOverride());
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // logic
});
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import methodOverride from 'method-override';

app.use(
  bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
  })
);
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(methodOverride());
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  // logic
});
```

Responses from within a middleware function can be in any format, such as an HTML error page, a simple message, or a JSON string.

For organizational (and higher-level framework) purposes, you can define
several error-handling middleware functions, much as you would with
regular middleware functions. For example, to define an error-handler
for requests made by using `XHR` and those without:

```cjs title="index.cjs"
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const methodOverride = require('method-override');

app.use(
  bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
  })
);
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(methodOverride());
app.use(logErrors);
app.use(clientErrorHandler);
app.use(errorHandler);
```

```mjs title="index.mjs"
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import methodOverride from 'method-override';

app.use(
  bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
  })
);
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(methodOverride());
app.use(logErrors);
app.use(clientErrorHandler);
app.use(errorHandler);
```

In this example, the generic `logErrors` might write request and
error information to `stderr`, for example:

```js
function logErrors(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  next(err);
}
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

function logErrors(err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  next(err);
}
```

Also in this example, `clientErrorHandler` is defined as follows; in this case, the error is explicitly passed along to the next one.

Notice that when you do not call `next` in an error-handling function, you are responsible for writing (and ending) the response. Otherwise, those requests will "hang" and will not be eligible for garbage collection.

```js
function clientErrorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  if (req.xhr) {
    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Something failed!' });
  } else {
    next(err);
  }
}
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

function clientErrorHandler(err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  if (req.xhr) {
    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Something failed!' });
  } else {
    next(err);
  }
}
```

Implement the "catch-all" `errorHandler` function as follows (for example):

```js
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500);
  res.render('error', { error: err });
}
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

function errorHandler(err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  res.status(500);
  res.render('error', { error: err });
}
```

If you have a route handler with multiple callback functions, you can use the `route` parameter to skip to the next route handler. For example:

```js
app.get(
  '/a_route_behind_paywall',
  (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.user.hasPaid) {
      // continue handling this request
      next('route');
    } else {
      next();
    }
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    PaidContent.find((err, doc) => {
      if (err) return next(err);
      res.json(doc);
    });
  }
);
```

```ts
import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express';

app.get(
  '/a_route_behind_paywall',
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    if (!req.user.hasPaid) {
      // continue handling this request
      next('route');
    } else {
      next();
    }
  },
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    PaidContent.find((err, doc) => {
      if (err) return next(err);
      res.json(doc);
    });
  }
);
```

In this example, the `getPaidContent` handler will be skipped but any remaining handlers in `app` for `/a_route_behind_paywall` would continue to be executed.

Calls to `next()` and `next(err)` indicate that the current handler is complete and in what state.
`next(err)` will skip all remaining handlers in the chain except for those that are set up to
handle errors as described above.
